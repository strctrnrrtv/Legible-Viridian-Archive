<span class="bluetext">(((A "Wexelblat Disaster," named after long-time
Viridian contributor Alan Wexelblat,  is a disaster
caused  when climate violence provokes a further
collapse in industrial infrastructure; for
instance, a windstorm that causes people to
be electrocuted by downed power lines.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Here's a new twist:  people angered by a collapse in
their infrastructure, who, as a method of protest,
go out and deliberately sabotage some other aspect
of the  infrastructure.  As you can see, this isn't
the classic Wexelblat formulation of "Mother Nature"
taking some ironic revenge, but people taking revenge
for what they consider to be the misdeeds of other
people occurring during a climate-violence incident.)))</span></P>

<P>"Hit by power cuts, women block trains in Allahabad</P>

<P>"Kanpur: Angry over acute power crunch, about 300
women blocked trains in Allahabad on Sunday.</P>

<P>"The women sat on railway tracks and shouted slogans
demanding quality power supply in the city. A number
of trains got delayed because of the protest.</P>

<P>"The protestors threatened that if normal electric
supplies were not resumed then they would step up
their agitation.</P>

<P>"'We blocked the train because there is no electricity.
If there is no improvement in the condition then we
will block the tracks again,' Sarita a local, said.</P>

<P>"Allahabad city is facing huge power cuts every day.</P>

<P>"The current demand of Uttar Pradesh state is around
7,000-8,000 MW, while the supply is around
4,000-5,000 MW.</P>

<P>"To add to the woos of the people the temperature in
the northern plains of the country is touching 45
degrees.</P>

<P>"Besides, Uttar Pradesh, several other northern states
&ndash; Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, national capital
Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan and Uttaranchal &ndash;
are facing power shortage.</P>

<P>"By one estimate, peak demand in India today exceeds
electricity supply by 14 percent.</P>

<P>"The vast Indian countryside, where more than two-
thirds of the country's 1.2 billion people live,
accounts for no more than 13 percent of electricity
consumption while some 40 percent of the country's
electricity supply is lost due to theft.  <span class="bluetext">(((Quite a
statistic; if every thief doubled his efforts there'd
be one watt in five for India's civil population.)))</span></P>

<P>"According to industry estimates, India needs an
additional 100,000 MW of power in the next 10 next
years with an investment of $100 billion to meet
soaring demand of an expanding economy.  <span class="bluetext">(((The 
world's full of stats like this now.  They truly
look surreal.  How much train-blocking do you
think it will take to get that done?)))</span></P>

<P>"India has allowed foreign companies to invest in
fully owned operations in the energy sector to
overcome a peak electricity shortage of about
12.2 percent."  <span class="bluetext">(((Hint: in a power crunch,
we'll be attacking those globalizing  foreigners.)))</span></P>
