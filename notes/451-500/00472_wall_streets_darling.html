Attention Conservation Notice: 
</dt> <dd>BUSINESS WEEK supplies
a handy scorecard for the movers  and players in
the Global War on Terror green-fuels industry.
Believe it  or not, the fact that this industrial
transition is  almost, actually happening in real
life is the best  Viridian news we've ever spread.
Goes on and on and on and on.  And on their website,
there's even more.</dd></DL>

A New Orleans Katrina photo essay, narrated by the
photographer who took it on the spot.  A major city
in a global superpower gets deep-sixed overnight
by climate change, and the population and their
rescuers stand around for days, utterly baffled.
It's gruesome  and remarkably scary, because this
isn't yesterday:  this is tomorrow.  For strong
stomachs.</P>

Climate change is wreaking serious havoc on the ability
to produce power by <STRONG>any</STRONG> means.  Hydropower goes dry.
Nuclear plants are on rivers so hot they won't cool
the reactor. Oil pipelines rust, oil derricks blow
over.  Windmills blow down.  You know what really
works dependably in conditions of searing Greenhouse
heat? Coal.</P>

"Ethanol is gaining rapid momentum in its battle with
Big Oil over how to fuel America's future."  The
American Coalition for Ethanol is keenly aware that
Big Oil wants to keep all the money and not
let them have any.  The difference now?  There are 35
US governors who imagine they can make big bucks
from ethanol and live like sultans.</P>

The agriculture future's market is going nuts.
If corn squeezin's really turn into a global fuel
source, you can start expecting foodstuffs
to act just like oil does.  The same goes for <STRONG>hay.</STRONG>
You get a drought, a bumper crop, we could see
lignocellulose-ethanol <STRONG>hay spikes.</STRONG></P>

"Aw, a guy who could sell the American population on
hay could sell air conditioners to Eskimos."  Y'know
what?  That's actually happening. The Inuit are
literally buying air conditioners to deal with the
polar heat.</P>

<H2>SPECIAL REPORT</H2>

<H3>"Wall Street's New Love Affair
"Why some of the world's smartest investors are
betting billions on clean energy</H3>

<P>"You sense it from the waiting lists for Toyota
Priuses. You see it on the faces of the solar-energy
stalwarts who are suddenly being showered with
attention. You read about it constantly in newspapers
and magazines. And you hear it on TV and even at the
movies. <span class="bluetext">(((And, you've been hearing about it on
Viridian List for eight solid years, because you're
a futurist, early-adopter type.)))</span></P>


<P>"Warnings about global warming grow more dire by
the day: Experts say Manhattan, Washington, and San
Francisco will eventually be under water unless
people start filling their tanks with corn squeezings
and bolting solar panels to their roofs."</P>

<A NAME="advertisement"> </a><br />
<div align="center"><H2 class="greentext">ADVERTISEMENT</H2></div>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Okay, go over to BUSINESS WEEK, click on the
stupid advertisement.  It's probably another screed
from BP.  They're getting way "Beyond Petroleum"
because their Alaska pipeline is collapsing.)))</span></P>

<P>"As troubling as the predictions are, <span class="bluetext">(((they're
"retrodictions," for those of us who've been
paying attention)))</span> even more urgent problems
are weighing on the American psyche these days &ndash;
namely the price of oil, which is surging past $75
a barrel, and the deteriorating Middle East situation.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yep, there's nothing quite like throwing a glorious
little war for oil and losing it.)))</span></P>

<P>"In liberal and conservative circles alike, <span class="bluetext">(((when
was the last time you heard THAT)))</span> energy independence
is becoming a national imperative, and renewable
energy is attracting an unprecedented array of groups.</P>

<P>"'We're seeing an alignment of the environmental
interests, automakers, the agricultural industry,
the security and energy-independence proponents,
even the evangelicals,' says billionaire venture
capitalist L. John Doerr. 'When did all those
[interests] come together before?'  <span class="bluetext">(((Hmmmm.
Let me see.  Well, they all fried together in
the American heat wave last month.  Does that count?)))</span></P>

<P>"You know a cultural movement is real when the
money men get on board. <span class="bluetext">(((Truer words were never
spoken, ladies and gents.)))</span>  In just the past year
a broad swath of financiers &ndash; venture capitalists,
hedge funds, investment banks, public pension funds,
and even stodgy insurers &ndash; <span class="bluetext">(((stodgy, DESPERATE,
insurers)))</span> have begun sinking billions of dollars
into producers of ethanol, fuel cell superbatteries,
microscopic bugs that turn glucose into plastic,
environmentally friendly pesticides, anything that
might tap into the green craze.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The "green craze".  It just sounds great, doesn't
it?  You know what's actually killing us?  The "brown
craze." That's been going on nigh two hundred years!)))</span></P>

<P>"Saving the planet, protecting America, doing God's
work, cynically exploiting a feel-good trend &ndash; call
it what you will. <span class="bluetext">(((How about: "one of the few
acts of industrial policy that might conceivably
keep America from collapse?"  Could I call it that,
or is that a little too "green craze"?)))</span></P>

<P>"Wall Street sees money to be made. When John V.
Veech, a managing director at Lehman Brothers Inc.,
showed up at a renewable energy conference
in June, he was amazed to see that it was standing
room only. 'If you went five years ago you'd see a
lot of ponytails,' he says. <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, those would
have been, you know, Viridian List readers.)))</span> 'Now
these conferences are packed with suits.'</P>

<P>"Make no mistake: The U.S. is not about to resemble
an eco-utopia anytime soon.  <span class="bluetext">((("Eco-dystopia," that's
another matter.)))</span>  For all the happy talk about
clean energy and green technology since the 1970s,
people just haven't adopted the gadgets and concoctions
written about in science magazines. <span class="bluetext">(((Because,
unlike scientists, business people are stupid.)))</span></P>

<P>"The government has provided billions in subsidies
over the decades for ethanol, wind, and solar
technologies to help make them more economically
competitive &ndash; without much success.  <span class="bluetext">(((Unless,
unlike the US government, they were a government
that actually wanted that to work.  Like the Danish
and Brazilian and Swedish and Spanish governments.)))</span></P>


<P>"In 1975 renewable energy accounted for 6.6% of
total energy consumption. By 2005 the figure had
slipped to 6.1%. It would take decades more and
tens of trillions of dollars to produce the
countless windmills, solar panels, geothermal plants,
and power-generating dams needed to mothball the
nation's coal- and gas-fired electric plants.
<span class="bluetext">((((Unless, by some unheard of miracle, they
were Brazilian or Danish. Oddly, they made
that happen even without Wall Street.)))</span></P>

<P>"And production of biofuels such as ethanol and
biodiesel would need to soar from 325,000 barrels
a day to nearly 16.5 million to replace conventional
road fuels.  <span class="bluetext">(((How much is that in barrels of
blood?)))</span></P>

<P>"Getting there quickly would be 'physically
impossible," says Steven C. Taub, director of
emerging-generation technologies at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, a firm that advises
big oil companies and utilities.  <span class="bluetext">(((I don't
want to question this guy's credibility, but
did BUSINESS WEEK <STRONG>have</STRONG> to find an advisor
for big oil?  I mean, couldn't they just ask
Dick Cheney, and have him say "green fuels abet
the terrorists"?)))</span></P>

<A NAME="bigger_piece_of_the_pie"> </a><br />
<H2>BIGGER PIECE OF THE PIE</H2>

<P>"Wall Street isn't banking on a radically different
future, though. It's merely betting that wind,
solar, biofuels, and the rest will make up some
bigger portion of the nation's $1.6 trillion
energy market &ndash; enough to give clean-energy
investing cred as part of a diversified portfolio.</P>

<P>"Their confidence is bolstered by the federal and
state clean-energy quotas that have appeared
virtually overnight.  <span class="bluetext">(((Gee, I wonder why those
didn't take decades.  Before gas was three bucks
a gallon, those were "impossible" goals too.)))</span></P>

<P>"Already, 22 states have ordered utilities to
obtain as much as 33% of their electricity from
renewable sources within the next 10 years.
Others are likely to follow. And given the
green-is-good mood these days, it would take
a budgetary calamity to prompt politicians to
yank clean-energy subsidies. They'll likely be
around for a while.  <span class="bluetext">(((There's already a
"budgetary calamity."  It's the price of oil.)))</span></P>

<P>"Even modest gains at the margins could add up
to real money for investors. <span class="bluetext">(((This is the part
where the BUSINESS WEEK demographic really leans
forward in its leather chair.)))</span></P>

<P>"Let's look at some small slices of the energy market.
Cambridge Energy, hardly a haven for green warriors,
expects demand for ethanol and biodiesel for cars
and trucks to more than double, to 6% of all road
fuels, in the next four years &ndash; a $28.4 billion
opportunity. It expects demand for power from wind,
sun, geothermal heat, biomass, and water to rise
from 2.5% of the nation's electricity to 3.4%.</P>

<P>"That translates to as much as $10 billion in new
revenues for clean power producers by 2010. And
these are baseline assumptions over the short run.
If the technologies gestating today were to make,
say, plant-derived jet fuel cost-competitive,
the opportunities could increase by orders of
magnitude.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Or, we could see a Mad-Max style Peak Oil
collapse where starving refugees are selling their
grandmas for a liter of moonshine, but either way,
the guys with some fuel on hand are gonna be
power players!)))</span></P>

<P>"Wall Street is champing at the bit to provide
capital. Last year, $17 billion poured into
clean-energy projects in the U.S. &ndash; 89% more
than in 2004, estimates researcher New Energy
Finance Ltd. Worldwide, the $49 billion collected
in 2005 was up 62% from 2004.</P>

<P>"Interest in this stuff is 'out of control,'
says Credit Suisse Group (CSR ) banker Paul T. Ho
<span class="bluetext">(((a Swiss banker named "Ho."  Now that's
globalization)))</span> as he sifts through stacks of
papers on his desk for potential initial public
offerings of companies that produce fuel from
corn, restaurant grease, prairie grasses, orange
peels, and municipal waste. <span class="bluetext">(((How about stacks
of bankers' papers? Those could be an endless
source of cellulose fuel!)))</span></P>

<P>"He says there aren't enough suitable opportunities
out there for all the requests he's fielding from
well-heeled investors.  <span class="bluetext">(((Oh the sorrow.)))</span></P>

<P>"There is a downside to the flood of newcomers
rushing in: They're sending valuations higher,
making good deals more difficult to find.
And lavishing capital on technologies that have
been stalled for three decades will surely
trigger painful dislocations. <span class="bluetext">(((Not quite
so painfully dislocating as losing the Ninth
Ward in New Orleans, but this is <STRONG>Wall Street</STRONG>
we're talking about.)))</span></P>

<P>"For example, producers of today's leading solar
panels, which use costly silicon wafers, might
soon be threatened by companies like Phoenix-based
First Solar Inc., which says it will make power
from the sun as affordable as regular electricity
within four years by using cheaper materials,
such as glass, rather than pricey silicon. <span class="bluetext">(((Solar
power that's <STRONG>too cheap.</STRONG>  Gosh, the pity of it.)))</span></P>

<P>"A showdown is also coming in the ethanol business
between conventional corn-kernel cookers and those
who plan to use more parts of the corn plant as
well as switchgrass and even municipal waste.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, Khosla says switchgrass car fuel for 75
cents a gallon. Says it in public, too.  I wish
he'd cleared that with Wall Street first.)))</span></P>

<P>"But look closely at how the market is treating
clean-energy stocks, and you'll see why the moneyed
elite are clamoring to get in. Since late 2003,
as oil prices have shot up, stocks that make up
Cleantech Capital Group's Cleantech Index have
jumped 67%, vs. the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index's 31%.</P>

<P>"A spate of initial public offerings by solar and
ethanol companies in the U.S. have delivered returns
of 31% on average since going public within the past
year.</P>

<P>"And the combined market capitalization of solar
companies worldwide has soared thirty-eightfold,
to $27 billion in the past 12 months, estimates
Credit Suisse.  <span class="bluetext">(((Thirty-eight times!  Folks,
the sun is a giant bubble of flaming gas!)))</span></P>

<P>"Given the euphoria, <span class="bluetext">(((don't worry, if you want
downbeat you can watch the war news)))</span> it's tempting
to compare green investing with the Internet boom
of the 1990s. But there are important differences.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, we get starved for power instead of subsidized
novels from Amazon.)))</span></P>

<P>"By 1995, when Netscape went public, the World Wide
Web already existed. In contrast, truly transformative
clean-energy technologies haven't even been created
yet. Think of green investing in 2006 like technology
investing circa 1976, when computer hardware was just
starting to be introduced. Bet on the next Intel,
and the sky's the limit.  <span class="bluetext">(((In point of stark fact,
the sky literally is the limit. Thirty years of
Chinese coal and the sky will be blacker than pitch.)))</span></P>

<P>"Of course, the green gains of the past few years
are directly related to the price of oil, which has
doubled since 2003. Oil remains the main lens through
which all energy is viewed, and it takes high prices
to stir demand for alternatives. Some economists are
forecasting $100 a barrel for the foreseeable future.
<span class="bluetext">(((You know another easy forecast?  "Blood for
ethanol." Really.)))</span></P>

<P>"Others say it would take only the briefest of global
recessions to push the price of oil below $40.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, but give us a global recession, and $40
will buy you a house.)))</span></P>

<P>Certainly the big payoffs for alternative energy
would vanish in a second if oil prices were to
plummet suddenly.  <span class="bluetext">(((They were supposed to plummet
because of Iraqi democracy.)))</span></P>

<P>"But the Street is focusing on the vast gray area
that exists between these extreme scenarios, wherein
oil prices remain high enough to keep renewable
energy viable and profitable. With oil at $75 a barrel,
it costs half as much to produce a gallon of ethanol
as a gallon of gasoline. Right now it runs about 6
cents to generate a kilowatt hour of electricity
power from wind, vs. a national average of 8 cents
for electricity from coal or natural gas. To bet
on renewable energy is to bet that those spreads
won't go away.</P>

<P>"NEWLY CONVINCED  <span class="bluetext">((("First they laugh at you,
then they fight you, then you win")))</span></P>

<P>"Even experienced oil pros are putting up money.
David M. Leuschen, 55, is a founder of private-equity
firm Riverstone, which co-manages about $7 billion
with the Carlyle Group  <span class="bluetext">(((brrrrr)))</span>) and invests
in all types of energy, including coal-fired plants.
It also has a $685 million renewable-energy fund
invested in solar power, geothermal, and ethanol
plants. Leuschen is a tall, fourth-generation
Montanan who operates more than 100,000 acres of
ranches, mostly near Yellowstone National Park.
He's no radical greenie; in fact, he doesn't like
to discuss global warming. That's "a debate for
scientists," he says in his office overlooking
New York's Central Park.   <span class="bluetext">(((It's a "debate
for scientists" until Yellowstone calamitously
catches fire. Oh wait, that already happened.)))</span></P>

<P>"Like many others who are financing and investing
in green technologies, Leuschen built his career
largely on his expertise in the areas of energy
that drive environmentalists nuts. In 1999, while
a banker at Goldman Sachs, he helped advise
Mobil on its $81 billion merger with Exxon.
<span class="bluetext">(((No comment.)))</span></P>

<P>"He left Goldman in 2000 to co-found Riverstone.
When some large public pension funds approached
him about starting a renewable-energy fund two
years ago, Leuschen hesitated, thinking alternative
power couldn't deliver decent returns.</P>

<P>"'Our first obligation to our investors is to
make money, and I wouldn't have initially
considered renewable energy the best place to
make money,' he says.</P>

<P>"Now he thinks otherwise. Leuschen isn't turning
his back on coal, which generates more than half
the U.S. electricity supply. But his company,
together with Florida Power &amp; Light Co., owns
one of the world's largest solar-power plants,
in California's Mojave Desert. <span class="bluetext">(((And after
Florida goes underwater, he may become the sole
proprietor.)))</span></P>

<P>"Investors in Riverstone's renewable-energy fund
have been told to expect annual returns of 15%
or so and perhaps much more, based largely on
the fact that most alternative-energy producers
are able to enter into long-term contracts
with utilities, some lasting 15 to 20 years.</P>


<P>"Investment banks are making long-term bets, too.
Instead of taking green companies public and
collecting the easy underwriting fees, Goldman
is choosing to own companies outright and keep
the profits for itself. It's putting $1 billion
into everything from wind power to ventures that
might one day produce ethanol profitably out of waste.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, but there may be a "Waste Peak."  Where's
Hubbert when we need him?)))</span></P>

<P>"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has invested in 17 wind farms
and hopes to get into solar and geothermal plants
soon. 'The wind business has been growing at 25%
a year,' says John M. Eber, managing director for
energy investments at JPMorgan Chase in Chicago.
'We're responding to today's market needs.'</P>


<P>"What's striking about green investing is the
sheer variety of players jumping in. Huge public
pension funds CalPERS and CalSTRS together have
committed more than $1 billion to green investments.
Multibillion-dollar hedge fund groups like S.A.C.
Capital Advisors and D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. have invested
in and financed producers of geothermal energy,
ethanol, and wind power. Even insurer American
International Group (AIG ) plans to steer
private-equity investments to projects that help
cut greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

<P>"And venture capitalists earmarked some $917
million for clean-energy startups last year,
almost double the amount in 2003, according to
research firm Clean Edge Inc. 'Almost every venture
firm now either has a clean-tech effort or a
separate clean-tech fund or a few clean-tech
partners and at least one clean-tech investment,'
says venture capitalist Bill Gross, who invested
in a slew of dot-coms and is now focusing on
solar power at a company called Energy Innovations
Inc.</P>

<A NAME="_once_burned,_not_shy"> </a><br />
<H2>"ONCE BURNED, NOT SHY</H2>

<P>"Potentially lush profits are luring business
luminaries, too, including Berkshire Hathaway's
Warren Buffett, Microsoft's Bill Gates, Google's
Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Sun Microsystems
co-founder Vinod Khosla. Such captains of industry
as Virgin Group CEO Richard Branson and General
Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt are plowing
hundreds of millions, and in some cases billions,
into green ventures.  <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah. but what do they
know about capitalism.)))</span></P>

<P>"Each green banker, research analyst, and investor
tells the story of an 'aha' moment. For Brion Tanous,
an analyst at investment bank Merriman Curhan
Ford &amp; Co., it came when he drank a glass of clean
water directly from the tailpipe of a Honda
fuel-cell car on display at an auto industry seminar.</P>

<P>"'Soon the question won't be whether you want a
fuel-cell car,' he says. 'It'll be, what color do
you want?'</P>

<P>"John Doerr, a longtime partner at VC firm Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers who supplied startup funds
to such New Economy giants as Google, Intuit, and
Sun Microsystems, got turned on to eco investing in
2000, when Dean Kamen, chairman and founder of
scooter maker Segway Inc., shared his vision for
how traffic and pollution would overwhelm cities
by 2030.</P>

<P>"Doerr, now 55, told Time in 2001 that Segway would
reach $1 billion in revenues faster than any other
company in history. When sales didn't live up to
the hype, Segway became fodder for critics, as did
Doerr's decision to fund the company. Today,
Segway has just $9.4 million in sales, estimates
researcher Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. Segway declined
to comment on the estimate.  <span class="bluetext">(((Maybe they should
have sold Segways with weight-loss treadmills
inside.)))</span></P>

<P>"But Doerr still thinks green. From 2001 through
this year, Kleiner Perkins has quietly committed
more than $100 million to nine ventures involved
in everything from coal gasification to ethanol.
One of them, Ion America Corp., is preparing a
launch later this year of fuel cells that supply
electricity to buildings. And in February, Kleiner
announced that it has earmarked at least $100
million of its new $600 million fund for green
investments.</P>

<P>"To Martin Tobias, a self-described 'Republican
tech-geek software venture capitalist,' what's
exciting is how the wave of investment is drawing
good ideas and top minds from universities and
corporate research labs.</P>

<P>"'This money is transforming ideas that have sat
on shelves for years,' says Tobias, whose attention
shifted to clean diesel after he cashed out of posts
at Microsoft and Loudeye.com.</P>

<P>"In 2005, when he walked into a former Seattle
brewery that owner John Plaza bought with his
life savings to make clean diesel, Tobias suddenly
recognized the potential of renewable crops. Plaza
was producing batches of diesel fuel cooked from
soybeans &ndash; and selling every drop as quickly as
he could make it. Together with Paul Allen's Vulcan
Ventures and other top-tier VCs, Tobias plowed $10
million into the plant and joined the company,
now named Imperium Renewables Inc., as chairman
and CEO. Tobias is raising fresh funds to boost
the company's production eightyfold.</P>

<P>"The whole attitude toward green investing is
shifting dramatically. Green 'has become a mainstream
business that's attracting mainstream investments,'
says Cambridge's Taub. When Mark Townsend Cox,
49, left his job as a portfolio manager at a
family-owned investment firm in November, 2002,
to start a hedge fund investing solely in
clean-energy stocks, many prospective investors
snickered or ignored him completely.</P>

<P>"'People would say, 'It's all science experiments'
or 'No one makes any money from it' or 'There
[aren't] enough publicly quoted companies to
invest in,"' recalls Cox, who keeps a small solar
cell in his bedroom that splits water into hydrogen
and oxygen to remind him of how simple green
technologies can be.</P>

<P>"With a scant $100,000, Cox launched the New Energy
Fund on Dec. 30, 2004. He quickly set about scouring
the globe for publicly traded companies involved in
sustainable energy or green technology. He found
more than 400 of them. His fund is up over 50% in
2006 and has more than $4 million in assets.</P>

<P>"FILTERING DOWN  <span class="bluetext">(((They do go on, but there's a
lot to say all of a sudden)))</span></P>

<P>"Last year it was ethanol that grabbed the attention
of Paul Touradji, head of Touradji Capital Management,
which manages about $1.7 billion. Touradji has been
roaming cornfields, sugar mills, and oil refineries
for nearly a decade. After working in the refining
division at Mobil while in college, <span class="bluetext">(((No comment)))</span>
he was recruited to join the commodity team at
Tiger Management in 1996 and became a protege of
former hedge fund titan Julian H. Robertson Jr.</P>

<P>"Touradji, who started his fund in January, 2005,
perked up when he heard that some states were about
to ban MTBE, a chemical added to gasoline to reduce
emissions without hurting engine performance,
because it had been found to contaminate groundwater.</P>

<P>"Touradji reckoned that refiners would rush to ethanol,
a cleaner substitute that also fit the bill. By
Touradji's calculations, there would be an ethanol
shortage even if supply zoomed. He bet on ethanol
producers' stocks and bonds and made private-equity
investments. By June, the wholesale price of ethanol
had practically doubled, to nearly $4 a gallon.</P>

<P>"Wall Street's hunger for all things green is filtering
into businesses that have been around for years, such
as the power-trading markets that Enron  <span class="bluetext">(((No
comment)))</span> used to dominate. Because so many states
have ordered utilities to draw a big percentage of
their electricity from wind, solar, and water sources
in coming years, traders must bundle in green power
as part of large transactions with utilities.</P>

<P>"'If you don't have the ability to play in renewable
energies, large deals are nonstarters,' says Beau
Taylor, global head of energy trading at JPMorgan
Chase.</P>

<P>"Markets for hedging products are percolating as
new regulations on utilities stoke demand for
emission rights and renewable-energy credits and
hedge funds dive in to get a piece of the trading
action. Already the global market for carbon
emissions and related credits has ballooned from
practically nil at the start of 2005 to more than
$11.7 billion by yearend, according to energy
consultant Point Carbon in Oslo, Norway.</P>

<P>"The market is on track to double this year. 'Carbon
has the potential to be the biggest trading market
in the history of the world,' <span class="bluetext">(((!)))</span> says Andrew
Ertel, president and CEO of trading firm Evolution
Markets.</P>

<P>"At Evolution's headquarters in White Plains, N.Y.,
contractors are busy setting up new desks and
terminals for the firm to double its staff of 50 &ndash;
including a handful of ex-Enron energy traders
<span class="bluetext">(((No comment)))</span>  over the next year. Profitable
since its first month in early 2000, Evolution has
seen revenues compound by 50% a year. 'We're saving
the planet, one trade at a time,' says Ertel.
<span class="bluetext">(((Only in the 21st century, folks.)))</span></P>


<P>"Phenomenal growth, for sure. But it's no coincidence
that oil prices have soared throughout the period,
from $17 a barrel in 1999 to more than $75 now.
If that upward spiral starts to unwind, the whole
green market could unwind with it, from emissions
to ethanol, solar power to superbatteries. <span class="bluetext">(((Unless,
that is, you actually believe that climate change
is a crisis.  A Category 5 up the Long Island Sound
would shut down Wall Street even faster than 9-11.)))</span></P>

<P>"Riverstone's Leuschen acknowledges this reality.
'It's the umbrella of high energy prices that's
allowing us to do this,' he says. "If oil went back
to $10, I don't think we'd be talking about
renewable energy.'  <span class="bluetext">(((He wouldn't &ndash; because he was
Exxon-Mobil.)))</span> But that's a risk Leuschen and
others are suddenly willing to take."  <span class="bluetext">(((After
spending decades of pollution cheerfully risking
the rest of us.)))</span></P>
