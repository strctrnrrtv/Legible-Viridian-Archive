<P>A classic Wexelblat disaster here.  Storm blows
out rails, train goes off rails.

<P>"Red China" becoming "Green China."  Tom "Flatworld"
Friedman thinks that we non-Chinese ought to be all
worried about that.  Look, if Red China genuinely
and miraculously became a truly Green China, it would
be high time for the rest of us to gratefully welcome
our global Chinese overlords.  They'd be leading world
civilization to a new sunlit upland.  The rest of us
layabouts could move over to China to open boutiques.

Weapons of mass destruction found!  They were dumped
onto the US continental shelf by the US military.
Enthusiastic fisherman, hastily exterminating the
remaining fish stocks, are dragging them up whole
with fishing nets.

<span class="bluetext">(((The United States came amazingly close to having
this guy become President.  Now, although physical
reality is lavishly backing up Al Gore's oft-rehearsed environmental themes,  he's writing plaintive screeds
for dodgy little online zines like SALON &nbsp; rather than
making legislation.  Well, we do what we can, eh?)))</span>
</P>

<P>"The time to act is now
"The climate crisis and the need for leadership.</P>

<P>By Al Gore</P>

<P>
Nov. 04, 2005</P>

<P>"It is now clear that we face a deepening global
climate crisis that requires us to act boldly,
quickly and wisely. 'Global warming' is the name
it was given a long time ago. But it should be
understood for what it is: a planetary emergency
that now threatens human civilization on multiple
fronts. Stronger hurricanes and typhoons represent
only one of many new dangers as we begin what someone
has called 'a nature hike through the Book of
Revelation.'</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I wonder who that "someone" was;  he's sure got a
nice line of gab.  I also wonder why politicians
always say "the time to act is now," even when it's
crystal-clear that the proper time to act was quite a
long time ago.)))</span></P>

<P>"As I write, my heart is heavy due to the suffering
the people of the Gulf Coast have endured. In Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, and
particularly in New Orleans, thousands have experienced
losses beyond measure as our nation and the world
witnessed scenes many of us thought we would never
see in this great country. But unless we act quickly,
this suffering will be but a beginning.  <span class="bluetext">(((Due to
lag-time in climate change, it's just
a beginning EVEN IF we do act  quickly.)))</span>
</P>
<P>
"The science is extremely clear: Global warming may
not affect the frequency of hurricanes, but it makes
the average hurricane stronger, magnifying its
destructive power. In the years ahead, there will be
more storms like Katrina, unless we change course.
Indeed, we have had two more Category 5 storms since
Katrina &nbsp; including Wilma, which before landfall was
the strongest hurricane ever measured in the Atlantic.
<span class="bluetext">(((It sure is subversive to blandly recite the
facts in an era so pulverized by neocon Lysenkoism.
Al also believes in evolution, by the way.  In fact,
Al knows rather a lot about science.  In his day,
the Internet was thriving.)))</span></P>

<P>"We know that hurricanes are heat engines that thrive
on warm water. We know that heat-trapping gases from
our industrial society are warming the oceans. We know
that, in the past 30 years, the number of Category 4
and 5 hurricanes globally has almost doubled. It's</P>

<P>time to connect the dots:</P>

<P>"Last year, the science textbooks had to be rewritten.
They used to say, 'It's impossible to have a hurricane
in the South Atlantic.' We had the first one last year,</P>

<P>in Brazil. Japan also set an all-time record for
typhoons last year: 10. The previous record was seven.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Also, tropical storm Vince managed to last long
enough to cross the entire Atlantic hit Spain this
year.  An amazing tale, isn't it? But wait till
next year.)))</span>

</P>
<P>
"This summer, more than 200 cities in the United
States broke all-time heat records. Reno, Nev., set
a new record with 10 consecutive days above 100
degrees. Tucson, Ariz., tied its all-time record of
39 consecutive days above 100 degrees. New Orleans &nbsp;
and the surrounding waters of the Gulf &nbsp; also hit
an all-time high.</P>
<P>
<span class="bluetext">(((I wonder what sci-fi novelist and self-appointed
climate expert  Michael Crichton makes of all this.
Has anybody  asked Mike lately?  Maybe he thinks that leftists have rigged all the thermometers.)))</span>

"This summer, parts of India received record rainfall
&nbsp; 37 inches fell in Mumbai in 24 hours, killing more
than 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
<span class="bluetext">(((Might I point out that the valiant Indians handled
their mayhem rather more gracefully than Bush did
Katrina?  Oh, and then there's Mississippi governor
Haley Barbour, that sworn enemy of Kyoto...  I wonder
if Haley will be available to take press questions
when Trent Lott's newly repaired house blows down,
yet again.)))</span>
</P>
<P>
"The new extremes of wind and rain are part of a larger
pattern that also includes rapidly melting glaciers
worldwide, increasing desertification, a global
extinction crisis, the ravaging of ocean fisheries,
and a growing range for disease 'vectors' like
mosquitoes, ticks and many other carriers of viruses
and bacteria harmful to people.   <span class="bluetext">(((Nice list. I don't
know about you, but I'm still in an almighty sweat about losing two buildings in New York.)))</span></p>

<p>"All of these are symptoms of a deeper crisis: the
'Category 5' collision between our civilization &nbsp; as
we currently pursue it &nbsp; and the Earth's environment.</P>
<P>
<span class="bluetext">(((Okay, let's weigh the odds here: industrial
civilization, two hundred years old; Earth's
environment, 4,500,000,000 years old.  Well, if
those two collide, at least it won't last long.)))</span>
</P>
<P>
"Sixty years ago, Winston Churchill wrote about
another kind of gathering storm. When Neville
Chamberlain tried to wish that threat away with
appeasement, Churchill said, 'This is only the
beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip, the first foretaste, of a bitter cup which will
be proffered to us year by year &nbsp; unless by a
supreme recovery of moral health and martial vigor,
we rise again and take our stand for freedom.'</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Okay, first, I wish we had politicians today
who could orate as well as Churchill.  Second, I'm tired of utter mayhem in the name of 
"freedom."
Al Qaeda are "freedom-fighters" and they ran a
dungeon big as Afghanistan; Bush is a "freedom-fighter"
and he's tucking abductees into Soviet-style "black
sites."  Freedom is as freedom does, people. Stop
citing freedom while depriving us of it as hard
and fast as you can.)))</span></P>

<P>"For more than 15 years, the international community
has conducted a massive program to assemble the most
accurate scientific assessment on global warming.
Two thousand scientists, in a hundred countries,
have produced the most elaborate, well-organized
scientific collaboration in the history of humankind
and have reached a consensus as strong as it ever
gets in science.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, sure, sure, but those scientists are merely "the reality based community.")))</span></P>

<P>"As Bill McKibben points out, <span class="bluetext">(((I hope it makes Bill
McKibben feel a little better to get name-checked
here; I can still remember the C-SPAN coverage of
Bill being led out of the Capitol in handcuffs)))</span>
there is no longer any credible basis to doubt that
the Earth's atmosphere is warming because of human
activities. There is no longer any credible basis to
doubt that we face a string of terrible catastrophes
unless we prepare ourselves and deal with the
underlying causes of global warming.</P>

<P>"Scientists around the world are sounding a clear
and urgent warning. Global warming is real, it is
already under way and the consequences are totally
unacceptable."  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder how this speech would
have gone over at the court of King Canute.  "The
tide's coming in.  Huh.  Boys, go write "totally
unacceptable" on that big wave with this stick.)))</span>

</P>
<P>
"Why is this happening? <span class="bluetext">(((Because we've been
morons, and now we've got it coming.)))</span>  Because
the relationship between humankind and the Earth
has been utterly transformed.

</P>
<P>
"To begin with, we have quadrupled the population
of our planet in the past hundred years. And secondly,
the power of the technologies now at our disposal
vastly magnifies the impact each individual can have
on the natural world. Multiply that by six and a half
billion people, and then stir into that toxic mixture a mind-set and an attitude that say it's OK to ignore
scientific evidence &nbsp; that we don't have to take
responsibility for the future consequences of present
actions &nbsp; and you get this violent and destructive
collision between our civilization and the Earth.

"There are those who say that we can't solve this
problem &nbsp; that it's too big or too complicated or
beyond the capacity of political systems to grasp."</P>
<P>
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, the collapse of civilization is the New
Black.)))</span></P>
<P>
"To those who say this problem is too difficult,
I say that we have accepted and met such challenges
in the past. <span class="bluetext">(((Uh, not really, Al.  Nobody ever
melted the North Pole before.)))</span> We declared our
liberty, and then won it.  We designed a country
that respected and safeguarded the freedom of
individuals. We abolished slavery. We gave women
the right to vote. We took on Jim Crow and segregation. We cured fearsome diseases, landed on the moon, won
two wars simultaneously &nbsp; in the Pacific and in
Europe. We brought down communism, we defeated
apartheid. We have even solved a global environmental
 crisis before: the hole in the stratospheric ozone
layer.  <span class="bluetext">(((Americans didn't solve any ozone problem single-handed.  He's conflating America and the rest
of the world here. He should add to our list of
accomplishments that we invented internal-combustion
vehicles and spewed enough effluent to destabilize the
whole atmosphere.  "What's good for General Motors
is good for America."  Now there's a political
accomplishment.)))</span></P>

<P>((In the meantime, you can enjoy the spectacle of
Lee Raymond of Exxon scolding his supine clientele
in the Republican Congress.  That's today's American
power elite hard at work there.)))</span>

<P>"So there should be no doubt that we can solve
this crisis too. We must seize the opportunities
presented by renewable energy, by conservation and
efficiency, by some of the harder but exceedingly
important challenges such as carbon capture and
sequestration. The technologies to solve the
global-warming problem exist, if we have the
determination and wisdom to use them.
But there is no time to wait.</P>

<P>"In the 1930s, Winston Churchill also wrote
of those leaders who refused to acknowledge the
clear and present danger: 'They go on in strange
paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to
be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity,
all powerful to be impotent. The era of
procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and
baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to a close.
In its place, we are entering a period of
consequences.'  <span class="bluetext">(((I'd like to warn Churchill admirers
that, once he'd slogged to the far end of that slough
of blood, tears, toil and sweat, British voters threw
him out of office immediately.)))</span></P>

<P>"With Hurricane Katrina, the melting of the Arctic
ice cap and careless ecological mayhem, we, too, are
entering a period of consequences. This is a moral
moment. <span class="bluetext">(((Yep, it's a moral moment likely to last
a couple of hundred years.  After all, that's how long
it took us to get here.)))</span> This is not ultimately
about any scientific  debate or political dialogue.
Ultimately it is about  who we are as human beings.
It is about our capacity to transcend our own
limitations.  <span class="bluetext">(((It's also about our capacity to endure
all kinds of new limitations being thrust upon us by
our ignoramus willingness to breathe our own trash,
like, for instance, wrecked major cities and our
shocking loss of an ice-cap.)))</span>

</P>
<P>
"The men and women honored as warriors and heroes
have risen to this new occasion. On the surface, they
share little in common: scientists, ministers,
students, politicians, activists, lawyers, celebrities, inventors, world leaders. But each of them recognized
the threat that climate change poses to the planet &nbsp;
and responded by taking immediate action to stop it.
Their stories should inspire and encourage us to see
with our hearts, as well as our heads, the
unprecedented response that is now called for. <span class="bluetext">(((Al is referring to Salon's list of climate-change
heavies, who are some very nice people, although none
of them show much conspicuous talent for governance.)))</span></P>

<P>"As these heroes demonstrate, we have everything
we need to face this urgent challenge. All it takes is</P>

<P>political will. And in our democracy, political will
is a renewable resource."</P>
