<p>JANUARY 6 &ndash; 12, 2006</p>

<p>Zeitlist: Politics</p>

<p><strong>Running Hot and Cold: A Dozen Weird Weather Moments</strong><br>
by JUDITH LEWIS</p>

<p>Katrina turned the weather into the year's biggest 
news event, as the natural world against which Bush 
has made war since 2000 decided to send back a return
salvo. </p>

<p>The storm quickly became a political portent for both 
ends of the spectrum, with Christian conservatives 
interpreting the supposed fetal shape of Katrina to be 
a pro-life meteorological statement sent by a vengeful 
Lord to ravage the Gulf of Mexico, and the sane world
noting apprehensively that hurricane season has been
worsening with steadily increasing ocean-surface 
temperatures. Bad as it was, the scientists added,
2005's weather is just a taste of what's to come. 
Here's the rest of the year in bad weather.</p>

<p>1. 2005 was the hottest year on record. This year's 
global average temperature topped the previous record,
set in 1998.</p>

<p>2. The Amazon River basin experienced its worst 
drought in recorded history.</p>

<p>3. The National Climate Data Center (NCDC) reported 
that nine of the 10 warmest years in history have 
occurred in the past decade.</p>

<p>4. Satellite monitoring in September revealed that 
the summer Arctic sea ice has shrunk as much as 40 
percent since monitoring began in the late 1970s. 
At the current rate of decline, there will be no 
summer Arctic ice pack within two decades.  <span class="bluetext">(((If so, 
I wonder how many of this list's readers will survive
to witness that.)))</span></p>

<p>5. Multiple studies showed that the higher average 
temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere over the last 
decade are unprecedented over the past 2,000 years.</p>

<p>6. Swiss and U.S. climatologists working in Antarctica 
built 'EPICA Dome C,' the longest ice-core record to 
date. Gas bubbles trapped in ice crystals record the 
atmospheric compositions over time. From this, 
researchers reported that today's levels of carbon 
dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, are higher 
now than at any time in the past 650,000 years.</p>

<p>7. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) reported that sea-surface temperatures in the 
Gulf of Mexico this summer were the highest since 
measurements began in 1890.</p>

<p>8. The warm waters contributed to the year's 
record-breaking hurricane season, with 26 named 
storms forming in the Atlantic. Fourteen became 
hurricanes, and Katrina, Rita and Wilma created 
an unprecedented triumvirate of category 5 storms. 
The NOAA also exhausted its pre-assigned list of 
storm names, and for the first time had to turn 
to the Greek alphabet. On the last official day 
in hurricane season, tropical storm Epsilon 
strengthened into a hurricane.  <span class="bluetext">(((This precedes 
Zeta, which fell to pieces today.  I guess this 
means we can start over at"A" if January brings 
another tropical storm.)))</span>

<p>9. Wilma played second fiddle to Katrina despite 
being the stronger storm. In Florida, Wilma was 
'the Big One' they've been expecting for a century. 
It knocked out the power for weeks, and left a 
destruction path wider than any previous hurricane 
in the state. With a central ultralow pressure of 
882 millibars, Wilma surpassed 1988's Gilbert as 
the strongest hurricane on record.</p>

<p>10. Scientists at the Swiss Federal Institute of 
Technology reported in the May issue of Science that 
the long-term process of global dimming, a diminishing 
of the sun's effects caused by an accumulation of 
particulate matter in the atmosphere, began to turn 
around in 1990. Since global dimming has a cooling 
effect, its decline could speed the effects of global 
warming.  <span class="bluetext">(((One really has to wonder what the hell
is going on with that.)))</span></p>

<p>11. Researchers on a scientific expedition in the 
Atlantic Ocean discovered that the strength of the 
current that drives the Gulf Stream &ndash; and bathes 
Britain and Northern Europe in warm waters from the 
tropics each summer &ndash; has slowed by 30 percent in 
just the past decade. Thought to be a consequence of 
global warming, the weakened current could trigger 
severe winters and cooler summers on both sides of 
the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>12. Outlandish weather effects materialized all over 
the world. On July 26, 37 inches of rain fell in 
Mumbai, India's financial center, during one 24-hour 
period. Four hundred thirty-eight people drowned or 
were buried in landslides in India's highest recorded 
rainfall. A record 22 tornadoes hit Southwest 
Australia in May, causing the state's most expensive 
natural disaster. In October, 78.9 inches of snow 
fell on Mount Washington in New Hampshire, nearly 
doubling the previous record of 39.8 inches, set in 
2000.</p>

along to the next piece, shall we?  Nothing to see 
here!)))</span></p>

<p>January 6, 2006<br>
Op-Ed Columnist</p>

<p><strong>The New Red, White and Blue</strong><br>
By Thomas L. Friedman</p>

<p>As we enter 2006, we find ourselves in trouble, at 
home and abroad. We are in trouble because we are 
led by defeatists &ndash; wimps, actually.</p>

<p>What's so disturbing about President Bush and Dick 
Cheney is that they talk tough about the necessity 
of invading Iraq, torturing terror suspects and 
engaging in domestic spying &ndash; all to defend our 
way of life and promote democracy around the globe.</p>

<p>But when it comes to what is actually the most 
important issue in U.S. foreign and domestic policy 
today &ndash; making ourselves energy efficient and 
independent, and environmentally green &ndash; they 
ridicule it as something only liberals, tree-huggers 
and sissies believe is possible or necessary.</p>

<p>Sorry, but being green, focusing the nation on 
greater energy efficiency and conservation, is not 
some girlie-man issue. It is actually the most 
tough-minded, geostrategic, pro-growth and patriotic 
thing we can do. Living green is not for sissies. 
Sticking with oil, and basically saying that a 
country that can double the speed of microchips 
every 18 months is somehow incapable of innovating 
its way to energy independence &ndash; that is for sissies, 
defeatists and people who are ready to see American 
values eroded at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Living green is not just a ‘personal virtue,' as 
Mr. Cheney says. It's a national security imperative.</p>

<p>The biggest threat to America and its values today 
is not communism, authoritarianism or Islamism. 
It's petrolism. <span class="bluetext">(((A neologism!  Welcome to 2006!)))</span> 
Petrolism is my term  <span class="bluetext">(((our Tom is ever the egoist)))</span>
for the corrupting, antidemocratic governing practices 
&ndash; in oil states from Russia to Nigeria and Iran &ndash; 
that result from a long run of $60-a-barrel oil. 
<span class="bluetext">(((How great that he noticed the “curse of oil.”)))</span></p>

<p>Petrolism is the politics of using oil income to buy 
off one's citizens  <span class="bluetext">(((Are you listening, Jack 
Abramoff?)))</span> with subsidies and government jobs, 
using oil and gas exports to intimidate or buy off 
one's enemies, and using oil profits to build up 
one's internal security forces and army to keep 
oneself ensconced in power, without any transparency 
or checks and balances.  <span class="bluetext">(((Wait wait, I've got a 
genius 'petrolist' idea &ndash; use the NSA to wiretap 
Americans who moan about gasoline prices!)))</span></p>

<p>When a nation's leaders can practice petrolism, 
they never have to tap their people's energy and 
creativity; they simply have to tap an oil well. <span class="bluetext">(((Yep!)))</span> And therefore politics in a petrolist 
state is not about building a society or an 
educational system that maximizes its people's 
ability to innovate, export and compete. It is 
simply about who controls the oil tap.</p>

<p>In petrolist states like Russia, Iran, Venezuela 
and Sudan, people get rich by being in government 
and sucking the treasury dry &ndash; so they never want 
to cede power. In non-petrolist states, like Taiwan, 
Singapore and Korea, people get rich by staying 
outside government and building real businesses. 
<span class="bluetext">(((I hope my Singaporean friends are enjoying this 
rare pat on the head from the NY Times.)))</span></p>

<p>Our energy gluttony fosters and strengthens various 
kinds of petrolist regimes. It emboldens authoritarian 
petrolism in Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Sudan and 
Central Asia. It empowers Islamist petrolism in Sudan, 
Iran and Saudi Arabia. It even helps sustain communism 
in Castro's Cuba, which survives today in part thanks 
to cheap oil from Venezuela. Most of these petrolist 
regimes would have collapsed long ago, having proved 
utterly incapable of delivering a modern future for 
their people, but they have been saved by our energy 
excesses.  <span class="bluetext">(((Unless they were selling us cocaine, 
in which case they were supported by our other 
excesses.)))</span></p>

<p>No matter what happens in Iraq, we cannot dry up 
the swamps of authoritarianism and violent Islamism 
in the Middle East without also drying up our 
consumption of oil &ndash; thereby bringing down the 
price of crude. A democratization policy in the 
Middle East without a different energy policy at 
home is a waste of time, money and, most important, 
the lives of our young people.  <span class="bluetext">((("Won't somebody 
think of the children?"  Hey, it's the OLD people 
who die in droves in Greenhouse heat waves.)))</span></p>

<p>That's because there is a huge difference in what 
these bad regimes can do with $20-a-barrel oil 
compared with the current $60-a-barrel oil. It is 
no accident that the reform era in Russia under 
Boris Yeltsin, and in Iran under Mohammad Khatami, 
coincided with low oil prices. When prices soared 
again, petrolist authoritarians in both societies 
reasserted themselves.  <span class="bluetext">(((Not to mention the new 
Venezuelan-Bolivian alliance &ndash; oil and cocaine, 
together at last.)))</span></p>

<p>We need a president and a Congress with the guts 
not just to invade Iraq, but to also impose a 
gasoline tax and inspire conservation at home. 
That takes a real energy policy with long-term 
incentives for renewable energy &ndash; wind, solar, 
biofuels &ndash; rather than the welfare-for-oil-companies-
and-special-interests that masqueraded last year as an
energy bill.</p>

<p>Enough of this Bush-Cheney nonsense that conservation, 
energy efficiency and environmentalism are some hobby 
we can't afford. I can't think of anything more 
cowardly or un-American. Real patriots, real advocates 
of spreading democracy around the world, live green.</p>

<p>Green is the new red, white and blue.</p>
