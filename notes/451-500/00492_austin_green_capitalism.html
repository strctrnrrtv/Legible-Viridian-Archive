<DL><dt>Key concepts:</dt> <dd>Austin Texas, Corporate Green, cleantech,
clean energy, venture capital, Austin Technology
Incubator, start-up companies, Clean Energy Venture
Summit</dd>

<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt> <dd>It's about a bunch of

<P>The first and possibly not-only Clean Energy Venture
Summit, which planned for 300 attendees and got 400,
me included.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cleanenergyventuresummit.com/">http://www.cleanenergyventuresummit.com/</A></P>

<P>The Austin Clean Energy Incubator, braintrust of
the event.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cleanenergyincubator.org/">http://www.cleanenergyincubator.org/</A></P>

<P>Austin Technology Incubator.
<A HREF="http://ati.ic2.org/">http://ati.ic2.org/</A></P>

<P>Letter from the Mayor of Austin, who has a degree
in environmental design:</P>

<P>"To the Guests of the Clean Energy Venture Summit:</P>

<P>"I'm pleased to welcome you to Austin for the inaugural
Clean Energy Venture Summit.  I believe you will find
Austin a unique place, ideally suited for the
development of the cleantech industry."</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Where the Mayor of Austin went instead of
attending this local biz event:  The Large Cities
Climate Summit.)))</span><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nycclimatesummit.com/">http://www.nycclimatesummit.com/</A></P>

<P>"In Austin, we have a long tradition of creativity,
entrepreneurialism and respect for our natural
environment.  It's the nexus of these traditions
that has resulted in Austin recently being named
the nation's top city for cleantech development."
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, take that, Green San Francisco, Green LA,
Green Chicago, Green Seattle, and Green New York.)))</span></P>

<P>"What sets Austin apart from many cities striving
to foster cleantech industry is the exceptional
combination of resources we're bringing together
to help us achieve our goals.  The Austin team
includes our municipally owned Austin Energy,
unquestionably the most progressive utility in the
nation; the Clean Energy Incubator, the first ever
of its kind; the University of Texas, with its breadth
and depth of knowledge; and the citizens of Austin ==
our most important resource of all.</P>

<P>"The Austin City Council recently adopted some of the
most ambitious clean energy and energy efficiency
targets in the nation.  To achieve our goals, we will
need new technologies to help us meet the growing
energy demands of our rapidly growing community.</P>

<P>"Our plan is to build the cleantech industry of the
future == and that means attracting the right talent,
applying the right resources and leveraging a great
team to achieve this.  I invite you to play a role
in this important endeavor.  Together, we can build
a tomorrow as limitless as our creativity and vision
will allow.  Regards, Mayor Will Wynn"</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((If you'd told me ten years ago that the Mayor
of my home town would be indulging in this kind
of rhetoric, I would have been turning cartwheels.
The Clean Energy Venture Summit was an intensely
dull event.  There was scarcely a "visionary" to
be seen.  On the contrary: suited, duely-diligent
lawyers and bankers were throwing millions of
dollars at engineers.  That's the work of
the world, folks.  This is our third swing at this
particular baseball:  1970s: eco-consciousness raising;
1990s, global political accords; 2010s, cybergreen
ecotech.   They gotta win, they must not fail,
because otherwise, by the 2030s it's gonna be
Khaki Green all the way:  a  future of All Katrina,
all the time, for everybody.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I conveyed these bracing sentiments to the
attendees. I then went to my Austin home to find
a tree in my yard freshly blasted by a massive
lightning storm.  As a Viridian guru, I'm pretty
much getting what I begged for here. But, just like
everybody else under our planet's overheated skies,
I'm gonna pay a price.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((And, as they like to say, "many others.")))</span></P>

<P>Austin Energy's political pitch:  a shotgun marriage
of electrical utilities and a (somewhat imaginary)
hybrid fleet of American plug-in cars.</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.pluginpartners.org/">http://www.pluginpartners.org/</A>
"Plug-In Partners is a national grass-roots initiative
to demonstrate  to automakers that a market for
flexible-fuel Plug-In Hybrid Electric  Vehicles (PHEV)
exists today. Plug In Hybrid Electric Vehicles can
reduce dependence on foreign oil, decrease greenhouse
gas emissions from vehicles, lower fuel costs,
make American agriculture a fuel source, save and
created American jobs, and increase use of
renewable energy."</P>

IT TOOK A WHILE, BUT THEY'RE MOVING AS FAST<br>
AS THEY CAN THROW THE CASH... AND BESIDES,<br>
IT'S SOMETHING OF A PRIVILEGE<br>
TO HAVE LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THIS!<br>
