<dt>
Attention Conservation Notice: 
</dt> <dd>You're basically at this guy's elbow as he goes to 
Davos to network with the Great and the Good.  There's a great deal of discussion there 
about the climate crisis and what to do about carbon.  Davos is the watering hole of the 
global plutocracy, so if you're interested in the tides and currents of planetary 
development, you're a lot better off reading this stuff than you are wasting your time on 
political blogs.</dd></DL>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Note: Peter Schwarz's Davos blogging has been severely edited for Viridian relevance,
 and yet it still rumbles on at awesome length, anyhow.)))</span></P>

<P>"PETER SCHWARTZ is cofounder and chairman of Global Business Network (GBN), now part of 
the Monitor Group.
From 1982 to 1986, Schwartz headed scenario planning for the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of 
Companies in London.
Before joining Royal Dutch/Shell, he directed the Strategic Environment Center at SRI 
International.
He is the author of Inevitable Surprises, and The Art of the Long View, and co-author of 
The Long Boom, When Good Companies Do Bad Things, and China's Futures."</P>

<P>DAVOS REPORT<BR>
Day 1. Tuesday 1-23-07<BR>
The Set Up</P>

<P>What is Davos and how does it work? Officially the meeting is called the World Economic 
Forum. This is their annual meeting, but there are many other meetings during the year 
held around the world, but this is their big event they are known for.</P>

<P>It was founded and run by Klaus Schwab in the early eighties as mostly a European event,
 but has grown huge and global with about 2000 participants from all over the world.</P>


<P>The participants range from corporate CEOs, heads of state, cabinet ministers, 
politicians, intellectuals, journalists, scientists, academics, celebrities and many 
hangers on. I have been coming to Davos off and on for a little over 20 years. The Monitor 
Group is represented here by Mark Fuller and me.</P>

<P>The meeting is organized around three kinds of sessions. In the main Kongress Hall are 
major speeches (e.g. Tony Blair on Saturday) and high level panels (I will be moderating 
the one on WEB 2.0 on Saturday with Bill Gates, the head of Nike, and the founder of 
YouTube, which directly proceeds Blair's talk, meaning we will have a very large audience 
trying to make sure they have seats). <span class="bluetext">(((Yes, it was Web 2.0 year at Davos, which proves 
that particular little surge has been smoothly mainstreamed.)))</span></P>


<P>The second kinds of session are panels on a large variety of topics in the smaller 
meeting rooms.
Finally there are the breakfasts, lunches and dinners at the local hotels on a great many 
subjects.</P>

<P>I will be going to one Wed evening on climate change and national security hosted by 
Global Business Network
(GBN) network member John Holdren and another on future IT hosted by another network 
member Paul Saffo.</P>

<P>Around all the sessions is non stop talking in the many lounges and sitting areas of 
the Kongress Centre.
Not surprisingly these are among the most interesting parts of being here. The day begins 
with early meetings and goes very late.</P>

<P>Before and after the dinners are many receptions, cocktail parties sponsored by 
companies and governments. The India one always has the best food, but the Accel/Google 
party has among the most interesting people. And there is, of course, the NERDS dinners on 
Saturday evening.</P>


<P>Today is mostly registration an early dinner and meeting up with a few friends. My 
first panel as a participant will be Wed afternoon on the main theme of the conference, 
"The Shifting Power Equation:
Technology and Society".  <span class="bluetext">(((Guess which side is
winning.)))</span></P>

<P>Day 2. Wednesday 1-24-07<BR>
First Sessions</P>

<P>Began the morning with coffee with Geoffrey Moore, Shai Agassi, Orville Schell and 
Baifang Liu, who brought along the former Chinese ambassador to China, and then John 
Holdren joined us.</P>

<P>I am currently in a fairly large session on Making Green Pay. It is a televised debate 
on CNN on several environmental and energy issues. (It will be broadcast at 6 EST on Jan 
28.) The first proposition was in favor of nuclear and clean coal. <span class="bluetext">(((Peter Schwartz is 
quite the New Nuclear enthusiast.)))</span>
Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/nuclear.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.02/nuclear.html</A></P>


<P>The affirmative was presented by Jim Rodgers, CEO of Duke and old friend (we chatted 
before the session.) and the negative by Vinod Khosla, a VC.  <span class="bluetext">(((The increasingly 
ubiquitous Vinod Khosla, representing the cellulosic ethanol contingent.)))</span></P>

<P>At this session we get to vote electronically on the propositions. The audience was 
asked to vote and the nukes and coal lost by 3-1, much to my surprise.
Of course my friends Orville Schell and Baifang Liu, sitting next to me voted the wrong 
way. <span class="bluetext">(((No, he's not surprised, this is wry Peter Schwartz humor
here.)))</span></P>

<P>Dan Yergin is speaking now in favor of the second proposition on markets vs regulation. 
The Chinese ambassador has just weighed in on the government side.
(One of the speakers just cited The Long Tail as an argument in favor of markets.) The 
audience voted
3-1 against markets, but Jim Rodgers just weighed in against the either or nature of the 
propositions.
<span class="bluetext">(((Daniel Yergin, petro-politics wonk.  "The epic quest for oil, money and power."  Well, it's not anywhere near so epic as it's gonna get.)))</span> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Yergin">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Yergin</A></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">((("The Long Tail," for those who haven't yet heard of it.  It's the number-one non-fiction book in China.)))</span> <A HREF="http://www.thelongtail.com/">http://www.thelongtail.com/</A></P>

<P>And the third proposition is on a global carbon tax now being argued against by Jose 
Goldemberg because setting the tax rate is very hard and would produce serious inequities 
around the world. He is in favor carbon caps and trading and efficiency regulation.
He is not surprisingly, as a Brazilian, for a strategy similar to what they did with 
respect to biofuels.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Prime Minister of Brazil to dress-down US President over global warming.  That had 
to happen.
Brazilians are shipping more biofuel than anybody in the world and if they get cellulosic 
they'll ship even more. 'Brazil has the political and moral authority  to demand that rich 
countries uphold their obligation to reduce world pollution, instead of creating protocols 
they don't sign,"
Lula said in his regular address on state radio.)))</span></P>

<P>Nicholas Stern is now arguing in favor of the carbon tax because of the scale and 
urgency of the risk.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Stern Report.  At last, economists figure out that it costs business more to ruin a 
planet than it does to maintain one.  Man, economics is a brilliant science, isn't it?)))</span>

<P>There appears to be some degree of consensus on the need to set a price for carbon, 
John Holdren and Lester Brown ended up on opposite sides.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((John Holdren, enviro-science wonk from Harvard, got the BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC 
SCIENTISTS to finally figure out that the climate crisis is scarier than
nukes.)))</span><BR>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Lester Brown, indefatigable WORLDWATCH guy, finally shocked American business 
senseless by pointing out that China will soon be out-polluting them, which, hey, changes 
everything.)))</span>
<A HREF="http://forum.wgbh.org/wgbh/forum.php?lecture_id=3062">http://forum.wgbh.org/wgbh/forum.php?lecture_id=3062</A></P>

<P>"The carbon tax won 2-1. It was a surprisingly good debate, though made a bit 
artificial by the extreme nature of the propositions.</P>

<P>The next couple of hours were spent in the large buffet lunch in which one talks buts 
eats little in a multilevel hall packed with a couple thousand people all with the same 
objectives, talk to the people you want to, avoid the people you want to and maybe get a 
bite to eat.  <span class="bluetext">(((I know this is getting a tad wordy for Viridian List, but you've gotta 
like these little human-interest details.)))</span></P>

<P>A number of interesting conversations in which energy and climate change figured large. 
More with Jim Rodgers (one of the ten US CEOs who came out for carbon caps last week) on 
how to bring the country around on nuclear power.
<span class="bluetext">(((Jim Rodgers of Duke Energy, not always beloved of the deep-green contingent, but coming 
round on carbon anyhow.)))</span>
Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.climatecriminals.blogspot.com/">http://www.climatecriminals.blogspot.com/</A></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((At Davos, CEOs actually do sit around discussing how nations should be "brought 
around."  Pretty much like Exxon-Mobil did years ago when they "brought around"
the US Senate to rejecting Kyoto.  Sure, certain people and interests can "bring countries 
around."
Happens every day, folks.)))</span></P>

<P>Coincidentally followed by a conversation with an old friend whom I had not seen in 
years, Prof Robert Socolow of Princeton. He is the recent author of a seminal paper on how 
to deal with climate change, in which he thoughtfully considered nuclear and how Al Gore 
had used his ideas but avoided the nuclear dimension.  <span class="bluetext">(((Like Al Gore is gonna  carry 
Peter Schwartz's nuclear water for him?  Sure, maybe someday, when no one else remembers 
the term "Three Mile Island.")))</span></P>

<P>Just as I finally made it to the buffet table Richard Quest of CNN the moderator of the 
next panel of which I am a member to join him and the others in the preparations. Our 
topic was the technological and societal dimensions of the major power shifts now going on,
 with the focus on things like virtual communities, the rise of the download generation 
and the increasing youthful elderly.  <span class="bluetext">(((Good clean fun, especially if you're a youthfully 
elderly downloading virtual-community guy.)))</span></P>

<P>The others on the panel included Shai Agassi of SAP, Bill Mitchell the CEO of Arrow 
electronics, (visual
note: if anyone wants a visual model of what a fantasy CEO and his wife look like, Bill 
Mitchell and his wife are it.) <span class="bluetext">(((I'm not buying this, unless the Mitchell wife looks 
incredible.)))</span>

<A HREF="http://www.arrow.com/media_center/news/2005_WilliamMitchellBloomberg.wmv">http://www.arrow.com/media_center/news/2005_WilliamMitchellBloomberg.wmv</A></P>

<P>and David Rothkopf of the Harvard negotiation project.</P>

Council and the Architects of American Power."
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rothkopf">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rothkopf</A></P>

<P>There was some whining about people losing authentic contact with each other because of 
new media and e-mail, etc., but I was the strongest advocate that far more had been gained 
in extending the breadth and depth of our communications and knowledge access.
Not surprisingly I also argued for the growing power of the youthful elderly.</P>

<P>(. . .)</P>


<P>In parallel to our session were several others structured similarly on economics, 
geopolitics and business. At the end the rapporteurs came to the big hall to report to all 
the delegates on the panels and their audiences' views. We were to vote on the most 
important issues and the ones we were least prepared for.</P>

<P>After much discussion, some of it quite good, a member of the audience said "but what 
about climate change?"
And then we voted and climate change wiped out everything else, fundamentally undermining 
the process the Davos organizers had so carefully put together to create a neat web of 
interconnected issues.  <span class="bluetext">(((Just like climate change is poised to fundamentally wipe out 
everything else.)))</span></P>

<P>But Ged Davis manfully came up at the end and gracefully recovered the conclusions from 
the panels that such phenomena as the emergence of China and India and the return of 
Russia to the world stage might also be very important, and the huge generational 
transformations that are underway also might be consequential. But climate change remains 
the topic everyone keeps coming back to.  <span class="bluetext">(((Because they have to.
Because it's getting worse fast.  Furthermore, Davos will lack snow.)))</span></P>

<A HREF="http://www.j2ski.com/snow_forecast/Switzerland/Davos_snow_report.html">http://www.j2ski.com/snow_forecast/Switzerland/Davos_snow_report.html</A></P>

<P>(. . .) At the Yale reception spoke with Zedillo about the impact of the biofuels 
industry in the US on Mexico, pricing corn out of the tortilla market for the poor of 
Mexico. They may have to break NAFTA to survive the US move in ethanol.  <span class="bluetext">(((That won't do. 
 Corn ethanol is crazy, unless you're Archer Daniels Midland.)))</span></P>

<P>On to dinner on climate change and national security chaired by John Holdren. The 
highlights happened to be two Brits, Sir Nicholas Stern and James Cameron, the young new 
head of the Conservative Party.
Sir Nicholas basically summarized his now very influential report arguing strongly that 
the cost of doing little was far more costly in the long run than taking strong action 
today. But it was Cameron who really surprised me. He wholeheartedly supported Sterns 
conclusions, (Stern is Labour) and then went on to argue that we need an international 
emissions authority, a kind of global EPA. Not at all Tory like.
<span class="bluetext">(((Imagine what happens if we actually get one of these master agencies of global enviro 
might, and, for excellent reasons, it loathes and seeks to punish the USA.)))</span></P>

<P>A Pakistani general described the horror of his work in relief in a 1971 Tsunami that 
killed nearly
2 million people in Bangladesh as the waves washed over them. It was the future he feared 
from climate change.  <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, except this time, they're
Cajuns.)))</span></P>

<P>And Nick Kristoff, the NYT columnist, chimed in with the idea that maybe the WEB 2.0 
phenomenon of bottoms up action might become a novel means of environmental enforcement, 
creating a kind of global ecological transparency.  <span class="bluetext">(((Sure, just imagine WORLDCHANGING 
with a billion dollars.)))</span></P>

<P>At my table were two&Acirc;&not;&acirc;€  amazing young woman, a member of the 
Brazilian Congress and one of a small group fighting hard on environmental issues in 
Brazil and a Lebanese educator and mother who is trying to preserve some hope for the 
future for her kids and students while trying to teach them something about the 
interconnected world of ecosystems in the midst of a dreadful conflict.  <span class="bluetext">(((The 
"ecosystem" will continue to be there no matter how many people kill each other.)))</span>
</P>

<P>Day 3. Thursday 1-25-07</P>

<P>Thursday Morning<BR>
The morning began at 7 with a breakfast conversation with David Cameron, the Tory leader. 
<span class="bluetext">(((One of the things I like best about not being a Type A global overachiever is that I 
don't have to get up and dress before 7 AM.)))</span>  He joined me because of a comment I had 
made at the dinner the evening before.</P>

<P>I must say I continued to be surprised by him.
He intends to really lead on environmental issues in Britain. He said, "After all 
shouldn't a conservative be for conservation?"  That was followed by an interview with the 
Dutch Financial Times on my views of the issues here at Davos. Then ran into Jim Rodgers 
again along with Tom Stewart the editor of HBR <span class="bluetext">(((Harvard Business Review)))</span> and Jim and I 
agreed to do an article for HBR on how a CEO addresses anticipatory investments in light 
of long term issues like climate change.</P>


<P>Then along came Paul Saffo to enrich the conversation.</P>

<P>Link:</P>

<P>Paul Saffo, another Davos futurist blogger.
<A HREF="http://www.saffo.com/journal/entry.php?id=629">http://www.saffo.com/journal/entry.php?id=629</A>
Paul Saffo: "There is no debate about global climate change here  because everyone accepts 
it as a fact; all the conversation is about  how to respond. And there is also a clear 
consensus that the  nation-state order is on the wane, and thus the discussion is all 
about what institutions will fill the void."  <span class="bluetext">(((The answer? Corporate
Green.)))</span></P>

<P>(. . .)</P>

<P>Now in a session on local energy solutions with people like Amory Lovins, Tim Wirth, 
David Victor, Angela Belcher from MIT, Bunker Roy from India and Bill McDonough.  
<span class="bluetext">(((Swarms of green wonks.)))</span> At the session with me are Bill Gross and Marcia Goodstein 
from Idea Labs, and sitting next to me is Orville Schell. Amory is now speaking and 
reminding everyone on how much is actually already underway all over the world. Angela 
Belcher spoke on the major leaps now underway in advanced materials that will enable new 
solar technologies.
</P>

<P>A Chinese delegate, CS Kiang argued that China can do a great deal because they are so 
inefficient, a lot of "low hanging grapes" as he said. He'll be in Berkeley in a few weeks 
and we will meet.</P>

<P>An Ecuadorian Rose grower just spoke about how they are becoming carbon neutral.</P>

<P>The Chief Investment Officer of Citibank and interested in how energy investing can 
represent a major new opportunity.</P>

<P>Early afternoon, just had lunch with Laura Tyson, discussing the upcoming Presidential 
election. She is hoping for another Clinton White House with her in the cabinet. In any 
event she has returned to Berkeley from London and I am hoping she will do a bit with us. 
Toward the end we were joined by Sergey Brin and Larry Page and the conversation went 
Google.
<span class="bluetext">(((Only at Davos, folks.)))</span></P>

<P>Also spent a bit of time with Kishore Mahbubani the Dean of the Lee Kwan Yew School of 
Public Policy in Singapore talking Asian Geopolitics. And with Bob Friedman from Fortune, 
who is doing a special Green Issue of Fortune <span class="bluetext">(((that ought to prove memorable, if only 
for the screams of green leftists losing their clothes)))</span> and would like me to do an 
article on our EPA work.
</P>

<P>Just finished three conversations: First was Richard Cooper of Harvard and former head 
of the NIC.
The main subject was Niall Ferguson of whom Richard had a mixed opinion, loved some things,
 e.g. arguments around. But thought Ferguson was on weaker ground when he dealt with 
economics. While talking with Richard, a hand from behind reached out and it was Tom 
Friedman. We went off to discuss his next column which will be about George Bush cleaning 
out his desk now that he has been fired last November. And that the Democrats ought to put 
strong climate change bill and an Iraq bill on his desk, inviting a veto.
<span class="bluetext">(((They'll get vetoes, but Bush is yesterday's man.
In fact, he's made his country into yesterday's country, which is incredible, given the 
fantastic geopolitical advantages that he squandered.)))</span></P>

<P>Then it was Baroness Susan Greenfield, a British biologist with whom I discussed the 
future of human biology for my upcoming Nature article. She believes the next great leap 
will be a deep understanding of how the brain generates consciousness.  <span class="bluetext">(((The brain 
clearly does that through breathing oxygen, so let's home there's some left in the 
atmosphere.)))</span>
</P>

<P>Then it was off to China. Cheng Siwei Vice Chairman of the People's Congress emphasized 
the commonalities that China had with all other nations. <span class="bluetext">(((Like, for instance, a penchant 
for exporting its oligarchs to Davos.  These people are supposed to be Communists, for 
Christ's sake.  We're about one good bird-flu sneeze away from a globo-capitalist coup 
de'etat here &ndash;  why do these people even NEED national governments?  They just suck up 
air-time and get in the way!)))</span></P>

<P>Pei Minxin of the Carnegie Endowment asked whether China knows what it really wants. 
Kishore Mahbubani raised whether the competing global visions would shape China. He made 
the argument that others echoed that China has become a status quo power with a deep 
investment in the current order.  <span class="bluetext">(((China doesn't need a nuclear arms race, it can wreck 
global civilization with coal-fumes alone.)))</span></P>


<P>Bob Zoelleck enmphasized China's participation in international institutions. Wang 
Jianshou the head of China Mobile made a surprising point to emphasize the scale. When he 
started the company, there were less than three million phone subscribers in all of China. 
Today China mobile has over 300 million customers. (. . .)</P>

<P>Then went to a session on petropolitics moderated by Tom Friedman with Rex Tillerson 
the CEO of Exxon, Jeroen VanderVeer, CEO of Shell (and an old friend), Sam Bodman US 
Energy Secretary, and a few more.
It was content free. They all avoided Tom's questions and the audiences. . . not a great 
performance.</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
What would a green Exxon-Mobil look like?

<P>(. . .)<BR>
After dinner it was off to another climate change event. This time it was the Young Global 
Leaders of Tomorrow (YGLs) who were organizing the event.
This is a group of young future leaders (mostly 20 - 30 year olds) had decided to take on 
climate change as an issue last year and this year they were launching a campaign that 
they had worked on for the last year.</P>

<P>The project looks hopeful. It is an effort to tie highly valued brands to climate 
action. But it was an all star event. At one point a photographer captured Claudia 
Schiffer, Hakken the studly young Crown Prince of Norway and I all in conversation.</P>

<P>Shimon Peres also spoke and he is always remarkable and inspiring. And it appears he 
will be named President of Israel in the next few days. By the way the Prince and I will 
be together most of next week at an energy meeting in Norway.</P>

<P>Day 4. Friday 1-26-07</P>

<P>My lunch event was on extending human lifespan. In the end there was a lot of agreement on 
the technology potential but the real issue they focused on was cost and associated 
inequities. If we can't all live longer should anyone?  <span class="bluetext">(((This question sounds especially 
lame and silly in the context of Davos.  If it cost 200 million dollars to buy yourself 
another 20 years of life, who would spend that kind of money?
Well, just look around Davos.  That's who.)))</span></P>

<P>The afternoon session was "The Next Limits of Growth".</P>

<P>Martin Wolf the moderator and said that Malthus was wrong for 200 years because of 
innovation and the availability of fossil fuels leading to rising agricultural 
productivity. Brabeck-Letmathe CEO of Nestle argued that innovation will continue unabated 
and that there really no are limits, if markets work (right price matters.) His big issue 
was water because markets don't work in water.</P>

<P>Sam DiPiazza, CEO of PWC also said no limits and reported on their current survey of 
1000 CEOS.
They are optimistic about growth (90%) but energy is a concern, along with climate change 
and resource scarcity. Isdell, CEO of Coke also said no limits.</P>

<P>The biggest threat is that we lose confidence in the growth oriented system as a result 
of income gaps, and job insecurity, Kindle of ABB also said no limits but the necessary 
energy substitution would lead to much higher costs. Chukwuma Soludo the head of the 
Nigerian Central Bank and also quite impressive said most of Africa's limits were internal 
limits. Water kept coming up as perhaps the greatest constraint.  <span class="bluetext">(((Even Davos is gonna 
suffer for water if there's no snow, guys.)))</span>
</P>

<P>Soludo, when the population issue came up, suggested open the borders and let 
population poor countries absorb some of the excess from the population rich countries.  
You can imagine how the Europeans reacted to the suggestion of vast numbers of Nigerians 
arriving on their shores seeking work.</P>

<P>The politics of water and immigration, not technology are the real constraints to 
solutions, they all seemed to agree. Van Jones of Oakland expressed a great deal of 
skepticism at the panels relative optimism and spoke for many others in the room.</P>

<P>As I was leaving for dinner, for the first time, ran into Gavin Newsom who promised to 
come by our new office to officially "bless" it. The mayor, as always, was in great form.  
<span class="bluetext">(((Used to be the greenest mayor in the USA, now has swarms of competition.)))</span></P>

<P>(.. .)</P>

<P>Then it was on to a Davos dinner which for me was a real treat. The main guest, who was 
at my table, was Mike Griffin, the Director of NASA. The other guests were the Chief 
Scientific Advisor to the Prime Minister of Japan and an old friend the cosmologist Lord 
(Martin) Rees, Master of Trinity College and President of the Royal Society. Griffin was 
astonishing, candid, insightful, imaginative, open minded, (a bit arrogant), though 
willing to listen, and willing to admit that he got something wrong. And not at all like a 
typical bureaucrat.
His vision is one of a space faring civilization and he doesn't mean the US, he means 
humankind.
<span class="bluetext">(((He'd better, because everybody's got a space program all of a sudden and the US is hard 
put to launch shuttles.)))</span></P>

<P>He loves the idea of space based solar power, Stewart Brand will be pleased to hear. He 
has funded some of the best innovative rocket technology like Elon Musk's Space X. So for 
me this was a really exciting evening.</P>

<P>As it happens sitting next to me was another space buff, Abdullatif Al-Othman, the CFO 
of Saudi Aramco, someone I have worked with before. He was an excited fan too, but he also 
had very kind words about the impact we have had on Aramco and invited us back.
Then things got weird . . .</P>

<P>(. . .)</P>

<P>At the end of the session my Arabian friend salvaged his evening when I introduced him 
to Joe Stiglitz and he got to ask Joe about the future of oil and he replied:"biofuels!" 
And as it happened I had just introduced him to Jay Kiesling, one of the leaders in 
synthetic biology whose new start up company will soon be focusing on bacteria to produce 
biofuels.
He immediately asked Kiesling if he could invest as this is obviously the future. (. .

<P>Day 5. Saturday 1-27-07<BR>
Saturday, The Final Day</P>

<P>(. . .)</P>

<P>This morning Tom Friedman quoted me in his column on what Bush should be doing on 
energy and the environment. As a result as the day went on many of the participants came 
up to comment, agree or disagree and it became one of the background notes of the day.</P>

<P>The afternoon for me was dominated by the panel I moderated in the main hall on WEB 2.0,
 with Bill Gates, Mark Parker, CEO of Nike , the founders of YouTube and Flickr, Chad 
Hurley and Caterina Fake, and Viviane Reding the Information commissioner of the EU, with 
a challenge from Dennis Kneale of Forbes.
The panel went well, everyone played by the rules and it really became a conversation 
about the empowerment of the individual by the new technology.</P>

<P>I began with the "Benjamin effect." The reason I got onto this early was not brilliance 
on my part. It was watching my son Ben uploading light saber fighting movies he had made 
for a competition with dozens of other kids and downloading original Lego designs from 
other Lego maniacs. Gates really was quite good with a detailed and imaginative vision of 
how people were going to use technology, a picture of rich and dense ubiquitous mobile 
access.
</P>

<P>The next major event was Tony Blair's valedictory address. It was insightful, 
articulate, witty, bold and even controversial. He had a wonderful self deprecating sense 
of humor. He had, for example, recently been at a signing of a bilateral climate agreement 
with the state of California where he had been standing next to our Gov. Schwarzenegger 
and said "it was the first time I had ever experienced body envy of another politician." 
He addressed three major challenges, climate change, trade and security.  <span class="bluetext">(((Do you know 
how incredibly freaky it is that Great Britain is signing bilateral agreements with the 
State of California?)))</span></P>

<P>Blair argued that China, India and the United States needed to accept binding CO2 
agreements. He went on to say that there was an opportunity for business to find an 
alignment between their sense of moral purpose and their business strategy in dealing with 
climate change and poverty. His really bold strokes came in arguing for a new framework of 
international institutions and instruments of shared action in several areas.
</P>

<P>Blair argued for the reinvention of the Security Council, new peacekeeping tools, new 
international means of nation building and a G8+5. The head of the WEF asked me to throw 
out the first question which I did.  How was Blair  going to convince the Greens of 
Britain about his new positive position on nuclear power? And he gave a highly informed 
and nuanced answer. . . but it was basically that we can't reduce greenhouse gases enough 
without nukes.</P>

<P>John McCain was on the closing panel and made one very important point: that Congress 
would pass a strong climate change bill and that Bush would sign it. You can imagine that 
was well received especially coming from him. (. . .)</P>

<P>Sunday 1-28-07</P>

<P>Mid day, Another Davos Moment, The Airport Lounge (. . .)</P>


<P>Looking back over the week it feels like there was little sense of urgency in the 
world. There was a lot of discussion of the big problems: climate change, water, trade, 
economic imbalances, the dollar, religious and ethnic conflicts, rising China and India, 
extreme poverty and many more.</P>

<P>But in the background was a global economy that felt fairly robust and from a business 
perspective times are good and no big threats appear imminent. You might call the mood 
complacent. There were no obvious big surprises or unanticipated crises.</P>

<P>The upside of that complacency was a sense that first of all the problems are well 
recognized and that we can even imagine how most, if not all can be addressed.
There was, for example, a broad consensus that climate change was an urgent issue but the 
only real question was what was the mix of solutions.</P>

<P>I can't help wonder, as a result, if we are not missing something.</P>
