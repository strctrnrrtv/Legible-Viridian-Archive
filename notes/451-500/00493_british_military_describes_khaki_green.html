<h2>Armies Must Ready for Global Warming Role &ndash; Britain</h2>

<P>UK: June 26, 2007</P>

<P>LONDON &ndash; Global warming is such a threat to security that military planners must build 
it into their calculations, the head of Britain's armed forces said on Monday.</P>

<P>Jock Stirrup, chief of the defence staff, said risks that climate change could cause 
weakened states to disintegrate and produce major humanitarian disasters or exploitation 
by armed groups had to become a feature of military planning.</P>

<P>Link: Air Marshal Sir Graham Eric Stirrup, (1949 -  ):
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_Stirrup">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_Stirrup</A></P>

<P>But he said first analyses showed planners would not have to switch their geographical 
focus, because the areas most vulnerable to climate change are those where security risks 
are already high.</P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((Interesting, isn't it?  The places where we've already got hell are gonna have more 
hell.)))</span></P>

<P>"Just glance at a map of the areas most likely to be affected and you are struck at 
once by the fact that they are exactly those parts of the world where we see fragility, 
instability and weak governance today.</P>

<P>"It seems to me rather like pouring petrol onto a burning fire," Stirrup told the 
Chatham House think-tank in London.  <span class="bluetext">(((Nice fossil-fuel metaphor there.)))</span></P>

Chatham House studies on climate change:
<A HREF="http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/index.php?id=189&pid=403">http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/index.php?id=189&amp;pid=403</A></P>

<P>British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett chaired the first debate on climate change 
at the UN Security Council in April this year. She argued that the potential for climate 
change to cause wars meant it should be on the council's radar.</P>


<P>Stirrup said the unpredictability of the immediate effects of global warming on 
rainfall patterns and storms meant flashpoints could be advanced by years without 
warning.</P>

<P>He did not identify the problem areas, but Bert Metz of the UN's Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change told the meeting they included Central America, the Amazon Basin, 
large parts of north, central and southern Africa and swathes of Asia.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((And New Orleans.  And maybe Los Angeles.  And
Australia.)))</span></P>

<P>Scientists say average temperatures will rise by between 1.8 and 4.0 degrees Celsius 
this century due to burning fossil fuels for power and transport, melting ice caps, 
bringing floods, droughts and famines, and putting millions of lives at risk.</P>

<P>Stirrup said the security threat was far more immediate than those figures might 
suggest.</P>


<P>"If temperatures rise towards the upper end of the forecast range we could already 
start to see serious physical consequences by 2040 &ndash; and that is if things get no worse." 
 <span class="bluetext">(((He's not a scientist, folks.  He's a general.  Well, an Air Marshall.)))</span></P>

<P>"If things do get worse you don't need to come very much forward from 2040 before, in 
my terms at least, you are talking about the day after tomorrow,"
Stirrup said.</P>

<P>He said the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington showed the devastation 
that attacks fuelled by political, economic and social deprivation could achieve.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It's a tribute to the political genius of Al Qaeda that, six years later, people 
still talk about the damage to two and one-fifth buildings.
Meanwhile, where the real paramilitary trouble is:)))</span></P>

<P>"Now add in the effects of climate change. Poverty and despair multiply, resentment 
surges and people look for someone to blame," he said.</P>

<P>Even if the world agreed quickly on a way of equitably tackling the climate crisis &ndash; 
which was far from sure  &ndash; the nature of the problem meant a significant degree of 
adverse change was already in the pipeline.</P>


<P>"That rapidity, alongside the size of the global population and the complexity of 
today's society, leaves us particularly vulnerable," Stirrup said.
"It is bound to present substantial security challenges of one kind or another."</P>

<P>Asked on the margins of the meeting if that meant military planners should opt for 
premptive action where they saw a security crisis emerging, he said:
"Only in the sense of building governance.
Recognising the problem is the first step."</P>

<P>Story by Jeremy Lovell</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((So, what's the story here?  Well, as I pointed out earlier, green design is winning. 
 Practically every state with a trace of civilization has got capitalist-green fever now.  
They'll even do it in the teeth of government opposition, as they do right now in the USA. 
So design, in the sense of a comprehensive grass-roots effort to change the infrastructure,
 is doing great.
It is scarcely necessary to talk about this; it has become mainstreamed.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((However, nation-states couldn't get it together to create a Kyoto-friendly world 
order, so we're seeing many failed states and hollow states.
These areas are defeating the armies of nation states through the simple tactic of 
becoming and remaining ungovernable.  This, as Stirrup is pointing out here, is making 
failed states indistinguishable from climatic disaster areas.
They are going to become the same thing.
Khaki Green, as an idea, is far from mainstreamed, but this article is a strong signifier 
of it.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The rain falls on the just and the unjust alike, but the rain is going to fall with 
particular virulence on places where there is no government.
No army.  No civil services.  And no functional ability to restore the infrastructure.
Peoples who defeat nation-states through tactics of civil disorder are going to be 
particularly vulnerable to climate-crisis starvation and epidemics.  After the era os 
operations-other-than-war, there will be mass-deaths-other-than-genocide.  Mass deaths of 
peoples, mass deaths of former nations, but without any institutional entity inflicting 
it.  That's the Unthinkable, but it is certain to happen, and is already happening in 
isolated locales.  The question for the next decades
is: how much Unthinkable, how big is it.  It's a process that "could be advanced by years 
without warning.")))</span></P>
