<h2>Impact Of Climate Change Equal To Nuclear War</h2><h3> by Viktor Danilov-Danilyan</h3>

<P>Moscow (RIA Novosti) Jun 29, 2007</P>

<P>Global climate change defies forecasting. Unprecedented heat, floods, droughts and 
typhoons brought about by climate change cause tremendous damage. The number of such 
calamities has doubled over the last 10 years, according to the Russian Emergency 
Situations Ministry.</P>

<P>Some experts think there is nothing to worry about == periodic alterations in the 
climate are normal. Some believe the general alarm is the result of a mere lack of 
knowledge. But then, the danger posed by climate change is no smaller than the danger 
posed by nuclear war, and we have to face and evaluate it, however vague it might 
appear.</P>

<P>There is no way to hide from global warming. In fact, the repercussions of climate 
change might be even worse because the entire climatic system will be thrown out of 
balance. The average surface temperature is going up, and so are annual deviations from 
it.</P>


<P>Natural calamities go hand in hand with warming.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((So do unnatural calamities; if we have an unbearable climate disaster <STRONG>that 
creates</STRONG> a nuclear war, that'll have to rank as an ultimate Wexelblat Disaster. 
Did you know Alan's got his own Wikipedia entry here?  Kinda awesome reading, eh?)))</span>
Link:<BR>
<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wexelblat_disaster">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wexelblat_disaster</A></P>

<P>Disastrous floods are getting more frequent in Russia and many other countries. They 
account for more than half of weather-related dangers.</P>

<P>Floods alternate with droughts in European Russia's south. Heavy rains in spring and 
early summer cause floods, after which there is not a single raindrop for three months, 
destroying those crops that survive the floods.</P>

<P>The Kuban and Stavropol regions, Russia's breadbasket, permanently face this 
danger.</P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((Why did the Soviet Union <STRONG>really</STRONG> collapse?
The Reds took the Ukraine, the breadbasket of Europe, lavishly applied ideological delirium, consistently couldn't feed themselves or anyone else, sold fossil fuels to get bread, then went broke.
So says Yegor Gaidar, anyhow.  Basically, this means that Lysenkoism, the political inability to scientifically face a very basic resource problem, eventually doomed the Soviet Union.)))</span> <br><a href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.25991,filter.all/pub_detail.asp">http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.25991,filter.all/pub_detail.asp</A></P>

<P>Economic disasters caused by natural calamities are becoming ever more frequent. The World Bank estimates Russia's weather damages, largely caused by climate change, at an annual 30-60 billion rubles, roughly
$1-$2 billion. <span class="bluetext">(((Kyoto == "too expensive to implement.")))</span></p>

<P>Floods, usually caused by typhoons, are also frequent in the Russian Far East-the 
Primorye and Khabarovsk territories, Kamchatka, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.</P>

<P>Winter floods are typical of the Arctic Ocean basin.</P>

<P>The spring inundation of the Lena, the largest Eurasian river, washed away the town and 
port of Lensk in 2001.
The town was rebuilt on a new site. The evacuation and ensuing housing and infrastructural 
reconstruction cost an exorbitant sum.
<span class="bluetext">(((At least they did rebuild  it, unlike Holly Beach,
Louisiana.)))</span><BR>
Link:<BR>
<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Beach,_Louisiana">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Beach,_Louisiana</A></P>

<P>Average warming in Russia due to anthropogenic factors is about one degree. In Siberia, 
it is four to six degrees == enough to shrink the permafrost area.
Pernicious effects are visible even now, with the borders of the taiga, forest tundra and 
tundra itself receding northward == suffice it to compare space photographs from 30 years 
ago with the latest ones.</P>

<P>The change endangers oil pipelines  <span class="bluetext">(((as you can see, Alan Wexelblat fully  BELONGS in 
Wikipedia)))</span> and the entire  infrastructure of Siberia's west and northwest.</P>

<P>Permafrost thawing has not yet achieved a scale that poses a threat of infrastructural 
accidents == but we can never be too careful.  <span class="bluetext">((("Wexelblat Permafrost
Disaster.")))</span></P>

<P>Warming also poses a great danger to regional flora and fauna, which have to undergo a 
very painful adaptation process. Considerable warming will result in changes to ecosystems,
 for example, broadleaved woods ousting the coniferous taiga. Warming makes the climate 
unstable, with bitter frosts and sultry summers, which is bad for both forest types == 
conifers suffer in the heat, while broadleaf trees do not survive frosty winters. So the 
biota will face many shocks before the climate stabilizes.  <span class="bluetext">(((Assuming that the climate 
EVER "stabilizes.")))</span>
</P>

<P>Warming is also a major problem for marshes and the permafrost, which will release 
accumulated methane and carbon dioxide gas. Gas hydrates from the northern sea shelf will 
vaporize. All that will drastically increase atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, 
spurring the warming on in a vicious circle.</P>

<P>The environmental balance has already been upset.
Many plants and animals will suffer. In particular, the polar bear's habitat is doomed to 
shrink, and millions of wild geese, eiders, brants and other birds will lose half of their 
nesting grounds in a matter of 20-40 years. A three to four degree warming may interrupt 
the food chain of the tundra ecosystem, lead to the extinction of many species.</P>

<P>Invasions of ecosystems by alien species are one of the worst manifestations of global 
warming. Thus, locusts are moving north, and have become frequent guests in the Samara 
Region on the Volga and certain other areas. The mite habitat is rapidly expanding, too. 
Pests migrate north far quicker than the border between, for example, the taiga and the 
forest tundra shifts.
</P>

<P>Once they find themselves in a foreign ecosystem, pests become gangster species, 
crowding out the native biota with dynamic multiplication.  <span class="bluetext">((("Gangster species."
One can see that this article was written for domestic Russian consumption.)))</span> Climate 
change thus brings epidemics in its wake. Subtropical malarial mosquitoes now feel at home 
in the area around Moscow.</P>

<P>Scientists who welcome warming as a boon for Russian agriculture are entirely wrong. 
True, the vegetation period is becoming longer == but this benefit is outweighed by the 
hazard of spring frosts destroying young crops.</P>

<P>Another argument in favor of warming is the energy that would be saved by a reduced 
need for heating.
But then, the United States uses more energy for air conditioning than Russia does for 
heating even now.</P>


<P>How can humankind fight climate change? It's no use opposing Nature == but we can 
reduce pollution and other adverse environmental effects brought about by humankind. The 
problem appeared on the political agenda in the 20th century.</P>

<P>The World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program 
established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988, which brought together 
several thousand scientists, including Russians.</P>

<P>The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 1994. One hundred 
and ninety countries have joined it since then. The document determines the scope of the 
international partnership to deal with the issue, whose first achievement was the Kyoto 
Protocol of 1997.</P>

<P>Intensive economic activities are surely bad for the climate. That is why the protocol 
demands a reduction in air pollution caused by methane, carbon dioxide and other gases. 
<span class="bluetext">(((It isn't "economic activity" that wrecks climate, it's "greenhouse emissions" that 
wreck climate.  They're not the same thing, and they've only been related for about 200 
years.)))</span>
</P>

<P>Russia ratified the protocol along with another 166 countries, and has been true to its 
pledge. It is introducing new, clean technologies for industry and everyday life. Cleaner 
air will help reverse the trend of climate change.</P>

of Sciences.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Defeated on the facts, fossil-fuel fans like to resort to nationalist arguments. 
"But he's Russian! Russians sell oil, don't they?"  Of course he's Russian; he also 
exhaled carbon dioxide while writing the article, and most of the Internet, with the 
exception of Google, Gopod bless them, spewed emissions while transferring his sentiments 
to your computer screen.  If you were born before 1989, you paid for the Cold War.  The 
point isn't who paid to prepare for Apocalypse == the point is that we successfully got it 
together not to have
one.)))</span></P>
