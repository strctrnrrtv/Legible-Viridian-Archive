<P>We can end oil addiction<BR>
By Richard Lugar / Vinod Khosla<BR>
Published August 3, 2006</P>

<P>"There is a growing consensus America must end its
addiction to oil. Yet there is despair we can actually
do so, short of draconian cuts in energy use that
would leave Americans sweltering &ndash; or shivering &ndash;
in the dark and trudging to work for miles on foot.</P>

<P>Such defeatism is unworthy and unwarranted. America
can end its addiction. Thanks to technology and the
new economics of energy, the time is ripe to launch
an energy revolution and shift toward ethanol as
a major transportation fuel.</P>

<P>"Unlike exotic alternatives such as hydrogen,
with ethanol we don't need new engines, or new fuel
distribution and storage. And we don't need a lot
of time or taxpayer money. With the right incentives,
a revolutionary transformation could kick off
tomorrow. In 25 years, ethanol produced from corn,
biomass and other renewable material could be
the dominant fuel for cars, SUVs and light trucks.</P>

<P>"This is not a utopian scenario. It is rooted
in sound technology, science and economics. It is
a common view we come to from different perspectives:
on the one hand, that of a senator long concerned
with national security who believes energy dependence
is one of the most serious crises we face; on the
other, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who has
invested millions in revolutionary technologies,
now including ethanol.</P>

<P>"The need to end our oil dependence grows
clearer by the day. Oil is a magnet for conflict,
a weapon for petrostates and a stimulant for
terrorism. The hundreds of billions we spend
on imported oil weakens our economy, strengthens
unfriendly regimes and hobbles our diplomacy
around the world. Petroleum is a source of
greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.</P>

<P>"At the same time, the business case for
ethanol has never been stronger. With crude oil
at $70 a barrel, corn-based ethanol today is cheaper
to produce than gasoline before all subsidies and
taxes. Ethanol from switchgrass and other biomass
using soon-to-be-available cellulosic technology
will cost still less, with dramatic greenhouse
gas reductions.</P>

<P>"New cars can easily be fitted to burn a blend
of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline,
called E85, as well as regular fuel. These flex-fuel
vehicles (FFVs), already on the road in limited
numbers, use low-cost, well-proven technology.</P>

<P>"Moreover, studies have debunked the old
anti-ethanol myths. We'll have enough land for
energy crops given the projected strides in ethanol
yield per acre, and both corn and cellulosic
ethanol, using the latest farm techniques and
modern processing facilities, have a high net
energy gain. Even if crude dropped to $40 a barrel,
ethanol would still be cheaper to make than gasoline.</P>

<P>"With economics, consumer interests and
national security aligned, how do we launch this
ethanol revolution? The key will be large investments
from Wall Street. Market forces begin to elicit
private funding, but far too slowly.</P>


<P>"It is time for government to focus the market's
power through incentives and mandates to give
investors minimal assurances needed to plunge
into ethanol with truly transformative investments.
Three steps &ndash; each requiring some political
courage but not much money &ndash; will help jump-start
the flow of private capital to this new energy
future:</P>

<P>"Require that most new vehicles sold in America
be FFVs by 2016 or sooner, a modification that
should play to the strength of U.S. automakers.</P>

<P>"Require all major gasoline companies to have
E85 pumps at half of their stations by at least 2016.
The tax incentives and mandates for these two steps
are in the Harkin-Lugar Biofuels Security Act,
introduced into the Senate in May.</P>


<P>"Ensure market certainty for investors so
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) or others can't temporarily push down the
price of oil and drive ethanol makers out of business.
This could involve a variable ethanol tax credit,
or a crude oil price floor, to expire once the
industry gains strength.</P>

<P>"By assuring investors a permanent market
will exist for ethanol and won't be undercut by
the oil nations, these simple, pragmatic moves
could turbo-charge the industry transformation.
The Energy Department targets 60 billion gallons
of ethanol a year by 2030, using conservative
assumptions. We say American ingenuity and
entrepreneurship could raise that to 150 billion
gallons, or roughly 10 million barrels a day,
versus current crude oil imports of 12 million
barrels a day.</P>

<P>"This modest government push would provide
more jobs for Americans instead of more money
for hostile regimes, support farmers instead of
terrorism, and promote green fuels over fossil
fuels. Let's start the revolution."</P>

<P>Richard Lugar, Indiana Republican, is chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Vinod Khosla is a venture capitalist.</P>
