<P><span class="bluetext">(((These are boom times in green awareness.
That boom will slow.  The longer-term challenge will be keeping up the morale of the human 
race once everybody realizes that the heat is on and blow after blow after shocking, 
sudden, unexpected blow keeps pounding global society.  Alan AtKisson has some wise things 
to say here, I think.)))</span></P>

<P>"A number of my professional friends are not celebrating this sudden emergence of 
climate change onto the world stage and even the big screen. Instead, they express a wide 
range of emotions, from puzzlement about what to do next (now that major world leaders and 
institutions have gotten in the game, some of the early thought-leaders will effectively 
be pushed to the margins), to a kind of sadness that has always been there under the 
surface but which, in the press of the fight, rarely could be expressed. The latter is all 
too easy to explain: being proven 'right'
about an issue that threatens an impoverished and dangerous future for both our children 
and our ecosystems alike is hardly reason for jubilation."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((So, yeah, there's the dent to the ego which comes from being right, but right too 
early, in the wrong way, and for suspicious reasons.  That's annoying, but adults will get 
over that. The worse part is realizing that one is settling right into that state of a 
lasting, impoverished danger, not just for a couple of undergraduate semesters but for 
decades on end.  It's not a matter of putting a shine on your shoes and a melody in your 
heart &ndash; the secret to survival under such circumstances is, pretty much, keeping busy.  
Just failing to learn helplessness.
Open new options.  Do things.  It keeps despair at bay.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((So, here's the planet's richest hippie, Richard Branson, offering 25 million to suck 
carbon and methane out of the sky.  I know this sounds facile and ridiculous: like, what's 
with the gaudy showboat humbug here, especially from a guy who runs airlines?  But you 
know what: gestures like this are going to keep some people from opening their wrists with 
razors.  Besides, a contest can't do much harm and might do some good.  The climate crisis 
is exceedingly grave, but we don't know every aspect of the problem, and a shiny 
fishing-lure like Branson's might pull some unexpected factor out from under a log.)))</span>

<span class="bluetext">(((and about a million other sources, because Richard Branson knows how to grab 
headlines.)))</span></P>

<h2>"Branson puts up cash for clean air</h2>
<p>Saturday February 10, 2007</P>

<P>"Virgin Airlines boss Sir Richard Branson has announced a multi-million pound prize for 
the best way of removing thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</P>

<P>"The prize &ndash; around L10 million ($28.5 million) &ndash; will go to the most convincing 
invention for actively absorbing and storing the globally warming gas in the atmosphere.  
<span class="bluetext">(((At least he's attacking a true problem &ndash; it's not enough to "reduce emissions," we've 
got to cease emissions entirely and remove the emissions already up there.  I know that 
sounds impossible, but it isn't.  Blandly watching capital cities sink underwater while 
major rivers run dry, that's what's impossible.)))</span>
</P>

<P>"Sir Richard has drawn up a distinguished panel of judges to oversee the prize, 
including James Lovelock, the inventor of the Gaia theory; James Hansen, the Nasa 
researcher who first warned the US Government of climate change; and Tim Flannery, the 
acclaimed Australian zoologist and explorer.  <span class="bluetext">(((Those are some greenhouse guys who've 
been sidelined consistently, now at least they get to eat smoked almonds and sip champagne 
in first class while they're flying to Branson contest judging gigs.
Hey, being right about the greenhouse can't be all
bad.)))</span></P>

<P>"Last September, Sir Richard announced at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York 
that he would invest all his profits from his five airlines and train companies &ndash; which 
he estimated to be US$3 billion over 10 years &ndash; into ways of developing energy sources 
that do not contribute to global warming.
<span class="bluetext">(((Okay, fine, the guy's "Corporate Green," but name somebody else who's done something 
that effective.
Exxon-Mobil only dropped a mere 16 million to logjam the Senate, and that minor sum was 
spent since Kyoto was invented, years ago.)))</span></P>

<P>"'Our generation has inherited an incredibly beautiful world from our parents and they 
from their parents. It is in our hands whether our children and their children inherit the 
same world.
We must not be the generation responsible for irreversibly damaging the environment,' Sir 
Richard said at the time.  <span class="bluetext">(((Boomers.  Man, they sure love themselves, don't they?  You'd 
think the guy had never heard of Ford, Rockefeller, and Edison, not to mention James Watt. 
 Boomers inherited a world that had just suffered World War II and was crazily fomenting a 
breakneck nuclear arms race &ndash; you can't blame Boomers for everything.  Never mind, carry 
on, Sir Richard.)))</span></P>


<P>"Sources close to the new environment prize say Sir Richard is serious about trying to 
encourage ideas that bring down concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or at 
least slow down the rate of growth expected over the coming century.</P>

<P>"The technology is called 'carbon capture and sequestration' and it involves absorbing 
carbon dioxide gas by, for example, chemically combining it with minerals to produce an 
inert substance that could then be buried either underground or in deep-sea deposits where 
it would remain for 1000 years or more.  <span class="bluetext">(((I don't think that cheesy stopgap will impress 
Judges Hanson and Lovelock much. Contestants had better think
harder.)))</span></P>

<P>"The idea is already being used to develop ways of capturing carbon dioxide emitted 
from power stations but Sir Richard's prize will concentrate on stimulating ways of 
capturing carbon dioxide from the general atmosphere, a much harder task because the gas 
will be in lower concentrations compared with the emissions from a power station chimney.
<span class="bluetext">(((It's a hard task, but a humble dandelion can do it every day.)))</span></P>

<P>"Sir Richard is known to have compared the idea of his technology prize to the famous 
prize established in the 17th century for the first person to devise a method of 
estimating longitude accurately to prevent ships getting lost at sea.</P>

<P>"The longitude problem was eventually solved by John Harrison, a self-taught Yorkshire 
clockmaker.
&ndash; INDEPENDENT"</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Okay, so maybe there's some self-taught algae geek in the woodwork somewhere who can 
turn atmospheric methane into artificial diamonds.
Can't hurt to trawl the media to get his attention.
When you think of it, this Branson effort is exactly like a Viridian Design Contest from 
eight years ago, only one million times more
expensive.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Now for another odd and intriguing pastime suitable for a Viridian demographic.)))</span>
