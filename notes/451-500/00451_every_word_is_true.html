<DL><dt>Key concepts:</dt> <dd>global warming, weather violence, Ross Gelbspan, denial</dd>

<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt>  <dd>This recitation of the obvious by longtime global

Especially the thousands of them that just blew over.</dd></DL>

Despite the evidence on the ground, the American federal government is not an entirely 
useless body. It's just been reduced to that state through determined effort. Some 
pleasantly detailed reportage on renewable energy
from federal scientists here.<BR>

<P>And there's a genuine poet over at the National Weather Service.
His (or her) Katrina forecast:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS...PERHAPS LONGER. AT LEAST ONE HALF 
  OF WELL CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE. ALL GABLED ROOFS WILL 
  FAIL...LEAVING THOSE HOMES SEVERELY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED.</P>

  <P>THE MAJORITY OF INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS WILL BECOME NON FUNCTIONAL.  PARTIAL TO COMPLETE 
  WALL AND ROOF FAILURE IS EXPECTED. ALL WOOD FRAMED LOW RISING APARTMENT BUILDINGS WILL BE 
  DESTROYED. CONCRETE BLOCK LOW RISE APARTMENTS WILL SUSTAIN MAJOR DAMAGE...INCLUDING SOME 
  WALL AND ROOF FAILURE.</P>

  <P>HIGH RISE OFFICE AND APARTMENT BUILDINGS WILL SWAY DANGEROUSLY... A FEW TO THE POINT 
  OF TOTAL COLLAPSE. ALL WINDOWS WILL BLOW OUT.</P>

  <P>AIRBORNE DEBRIS WILL BE WIDESPREAD...AND MAY INCLUDE HEAVY ITEMS SUCH AS HOUSEHOLD 
  APPLIANCES AND EVEN LIGHT VEHICLES. SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES AND LIGHT TRUCKS WILL BE MOVED. 
  THE BLOWN DEBRIS WILL CREATE  ADDITIONAL DESTRUCTION. PERSONS...PETS...AND LIVESTOCK 
  EXPOSED TO THE WINDS WILL FACE CERTAIN DEATH IF STRUCK.</P>

  <P>POWER OUTAGES WILL LAST FOR WEEKS... AS MOST POWER POLES WILL BE DOWN AND 
  TRANSFORMERS DESTROYED. WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN 
  STANDARDS.</P>

  <P>THE VAST MAJORITY OF NATIVE TREES WILL BE SNAPPED OR UPROOTED. ONLY THE HEARTIEST 
  WILL REMAIN STANDING...BUT BE TOTALLY DEFOLIATED. FEW CROPS WILL REMAIN. LIVESTOCK LEFT 
  EXPOSED TO THE WINDS WILL BE KILLED.</P>

<h2>Katrina's real name</h2>

<P>By Ross Gelbspan, August 30, 2005</P>

<P>The hurricane that struck Louisiana yesterday was nicknamed Katrina by the 
National Weather Service. Its real name is global warming.</P>

  <P>When the year began with a two-foot snowfall in Los Angeles, the cause was 
  global warming.</P>

  <P>When 124-mile-an-hour winds shut down nuclear plants in Scandinavia and cut 
  power to hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland and the United Kingdom, the driver was 
  global warming.</P>

  <P>When a severe drought in the Midwest dropped water levels in the Missouri 
  River to their lowest on record earlier this summer, the reason was global warming.</P>

  <P>In July, when the worst drought on record triggered wildfires in Spain and 
  Portugal and left water levels in France at their lowest in 30 years, the explanation was 
  global warming.</P>

  <P>When a lethal heat wave in Arizona kept temperatures above 110 degrees and 
  killed more than 20 people in one week, the culprit was global warming.</P>

  <P>And when the Indian city of Bombay (Mumbai) received 37 inches of rain in 
  one day &ndash; killing 1,000 people and disrupting the lives of 20 million others &ndash; the 
  villain was global warming.</P>

<P>As the atmosphere warms, it generates longer droughts, more-intense downpours, 
more-frequent heat waves, and more-severe storms.</P>
 <P>Although Katrina began as a relatively small hurricane that glanced off 
  south Florida, it was supercharged with extraordinary intensity by the relatively 
  blistering sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.</P>

  <P>The consequences are as heartbreaking as they are terrifying.</P>

  <P>Unfortunately, very few people in America know the real name of Hurricane 
  Katrina because the coal and oil industries have spent millions of dollars to keep the 
  public in doubt about the issue.</P>

  <P>The reason is simple: To allow the climate to stabilize requires humanity to 
  cut its use of coal and oil by 70 percent. That, of course, threatens the survival of one 
  of the largest commercial enterprises in history.</P>

  <P>In 1995, public utility hearings in Minnesota found that the coal industry 
  had paid more than $1 million to four scientists who were public dissenters on global 
  warming. And ExxonMobil has spent more than $13 million since 1998 on an anti-global 
  warming public relations and lobbying campaign.</P>

  <P>In 2000, big oil and big coal scored their biggest electoral victory yet 
  when President George W. Bush was elected president &ndash; and subsequently took suggestions 
  from the industry for his climate and energy policies.</P>

  <P>As the pace of climate change accelerates, many researchers fear we have 
  already entered a period of irreversible runaway climate change.</P>

  <P>Against this background, the ignorance of the American public about global 
  warming stands out as an indictment of the US media.</P>

  <P>When the US press has bothered to cover the subject of global warming, it 
  has focused almost exclusively on its political and diplomatic aspects and not on what the 
  warming is doing to our agriculture, water supplies, plant and animal life, public health, 
  and weather.</P>

  <P>For years, the fossil fuel industry has lobbied the media to accord the same 
  weight to a handful of global warming skeptics that it accords the findings of the 
  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change &ndash; more than 2,000 scientists from 100 countries 
  reporting to the United Nations.</P>

  <P>Today, with the science having become even more robust &ndash; and the impacts as 
  visible as the megastorm that covered much of the Gulf of Mexico &ndash; the press bears a 
  share of the guilt for our self-induced destruction with the oil and coal industries.</P>

  <P>As a Bostonian, I am afraid that the coming winter will &ndash; like last winter 
  &ndash; be unusually short and devastatingly severe. At the beginning of 2005, a deadly ice 
  storm knocked out power to thousands of people in New England and dropped a record-setting 
  42.2 inches of snow on Boston.</P>

  <P>The conventional name of the month was January. Its real name is global 
  warming.</P>
