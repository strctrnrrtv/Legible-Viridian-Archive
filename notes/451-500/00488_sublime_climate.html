<P>Exxon in terror.  Boy that stuff's sure fun to watch.
It's barely starting. Even the hopelessly benumbed US Congress knows where to look for a 
whipping boy.
Exxon-Mobil HQ.  Where else and who else is there?</P>

<p>Group Seeks ExxonMobil Records on Global Warming Spin SANTA MONICA, California, 
  February 2, 2007 (ENS) &ndash; The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, FTCR, today 
  called on Congress to subpoena ExxonMobil's records and probe the oil giant's funding of 
  organizations involved in disputing the reality of global warming.</p>


<P>FTCR urged Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to launch 
the investigation after a report in the British newspaper, "The Guardian," that the 
Exxon-financed American Enterprise Institute was offering scientists and economists 
$10,000 each to write articles undercutting the report from the UN's Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, IPCC. Travel expenses were also being offered.</P>

<P>The American Enterprise Institute has received more than $1.6 million from ExxonMobil 
and more than 20 of its staff have worked as consultants to the Bush administration, which 
has in the past resisted reports of global warming, although top White House and Energy 
Department officials said today that the administration agrees with the findings of the 
IPCC report.</P>

<P>Lee Raymond, a former head of ExxonMobil, is the vice-chairman of AEI's board of 
trustees, "The Guardian" reported.</P>

  <P>"Exxon Mobil made a profit of $40 billion last year &ndash; more than any company ever &ndash; 
  not just on the backs of overcharged motorists, but at the expense of human life on Earth 
  itself. Now it's using the profits to bury the evidence and distract attention from the 
  most serious problem the world faces," said John Simpson, FTCR consumer advocate.<BR>
  </P>

  <P><span class="bluetext">(((Wait till climate victims ask Exxon-Mobil to pay for funerals.  No, they won't 
  "ask" &ndash; they'll demand.  Even worse, quite a lot of the deceased will be Exxon-Mobil 
  employees and shareholders.  After 25 years of dissociating the media, Exxon's trying to 
  dissociate themselves from "inaccurate media reports"?  Who else is there to blame?  
  They've methodically made themselves into the planet's ultimate scapegoat.)))</span></P>

Henry Waxman's Attack on Bush Global Warming Distortions By James Ridgeway "Henry Waxman, 
chairman of the House Committee  on Oversight  and Government Reform, opened oversight 
hearings this morning  with a sharp attack on Phil Cooney, the former oil lobbyist  who 
headed the Council of Environmental Quality,  for tampering with scientific reports on 
global  warming in order downplay its importance.
</P>

<P>"Cooney  resigned in 2005 after he was publicly criticized  for playing  politics with 
global warming.
One New York Times report discussing government climate change reports written in 2002 and 
2003 said, 'In a section on the need for research into how warming might change water 
availability and flooding, [Cooney] crossed out a paragraph describing the projected 
reduction of mountain glaciers and snowpack. His note in the margins explained that this 
was 'straying from research strategy into speculative findings/musings.'" <span class="bluetext">(((Cooney's 
headed for jail.  Not right away, but watch what happens when those glaciers recede.  
Somebody's gotta go.  Of course it'll be the likes of Cooney.  Who else is gonna go to 
jail for climate crisis?  A bunch of Chinese coal commissars? Of course it's gonna be him! 
Him and any fool who dares to try to  help him.  He didn't have that figured earlier, but 
that's because he's greedy and stupid.  He sure knows it now.  Watch him fight the 
inevitable with his ever-dwindling resources.
Against ever-angrier, ever-growing enemies.
It's gonna be rather horrible, like watching a weevil pop and burn under a magnifying 
glass.
I'd spare the wretch if it was up to me, but that's way beyond the reach of us pundits 
now.  The apparatchik here is  blackened toast.)))</span></P>

<P>Pond-scum single-cell biodiesel.  "Algae makes oil naturally. Raw algae can be 
processed to make biocrude, the renewable equivalent of petroleum, and refined to make 
gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and chemical feedstocks for plastics and drugs. Indeed, it can 
be processed at existing oil refineries to make just about anything that can be made from 
crude oil."

<!-- end of auto-detected mail header -->
<BR>

<P>As this call for submissions goes to press, the National Climatic Data Center in 
Asheville, N.C.
(NOAA) announced 2006 was the warmest year on record for the U.S. The Cambridge School of 
Weston will open its doors to The Garthwaite Center for Science and Art, a sustainable 
science building and art gallery, in the fall of 2007. For the building's first exhibition 
season, we are reaching out to artists and scientists alike who explore issues and themes 
related to global warming. The exhibition will run from November 2007 through the first 
week of February 2008. Further details will be announced. All media will be considered; 
however, large work may not be able to be accommodated.</P>

<P>In addition to exhibiting works of contemporary art and science, we also invite 
proposals from individuals who would be willing to partake in a symposium on global 
warming, or otherwise are willing to work with our students in some capacity.</P>


<P>Submissions should include examples of work via slides or digital media, a resume, 
along with any appropriate written proposal or documentation. Please include a S.A.S.E., 
for the eventual return of materials, and contact information. Do not send large files 
digitally at this point.</P>

<P>Send all materials to Todd Bartel, The Cambridge School of Weston, 45 Georgian Road, 
Weston, MA, 02493.
The deadline for submissions is April 30, 2007.
For questions please contact <br><a href="mailto:tbartel@csw.org">tbartel@csw.org</A>.</P>
