Nowadays we  Viridians get rather more interested

Give it another ten years, and something like the

economics is so counterintuitive that I got all

<P>"Repeat after me: We humans have screwed up our planet. Feels better, doesn't it?</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">((("We humans have screwed up our planet, we humans
have screwed up our planet, we humans have screwed
up our planet."  Hey wait!  Facing the awful truth
DOES feel better.)))</span></P>

<P>"Now that we've accepted this reality, at least we
don't have to argue about it anymore. Atmospheric
carbon dioxide levels are at the highest they've
been in at least 800,000 years. Greenland's ice
sheet is melting fast. Some == probably a lot == of
the current warming trend is because of us, and so
are the consequent threats to ecosystems, food
supplies, coastal cities, and all that other stuff
from <STRONG>An Inconvenient Truth.</STRONG></P>

<P>"Of course, that means we're responsible for repairing
the damage, but stopgaps like carbon sequestration
just aren't going to cut it.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Actually, it means that we human beings from
the last two full centuries of fossil-fuel use are
"responsible for repairing the damage," and most of
us are dead. I'd say the clearest implication here
is that WIRED readers would also be dead long before
"humans" fully repair this situation, but what the
heck, read on.)))</span></P>

<P>"Luckily, a growing number of scientists are thinking
more aggressively, developing incredibly ambitious
technical fixes to cool the planet. <span class="bluetext">(((Uh-oh.
Ever hear the useful expression, "Be careful what
you wish for, you might get what you want?"
That would be the Viridian moment o' truth there,
when the ecosystem design boffins just roll the
gizmo right off the launching pad and turn the
blue sky bright green.)))</span></P>

<P>"These efforts to remedy the accidental experiment
of climate change with intentional, megascale
experimentation are called geoengineering.
<span class="bluetext">(((Or, as Stewart Brand points out, "we're already
terraforming so we might as well get good at it.")))</span></P>

<P>"Thus far, ideas include reflecting sunlight with
gazillions of orbiting featherweight mirrors or by
saturating the stratosphere with sulfur, or
increasing the volume of microbes that eat CO2 by
fertilizing the oceans with iron.</P>

<P>"Harebrained? Well, maybe. But somebody has to save
the world.</P>

<P>"Typically, sober environmentalists have looked
askance at geoengineering. In fact, they mostly
think it's nuts. All the ideas on the table reek
of foolhardiness. We have only one Earth, and it
is a system of unparalleled complexity (in other
words, no one knows exactly how it works).</P>

<P>"What if we muck it up? 'If you go down the path
of geoengineering, it leads to taking ever-increasing
environmental risk, and, eventually, you'll be
unlucky,' says Ken Caldeira, a climatologist at
Stanford University. <span class="bluetext">(((Maybe we’re ALREADY unlucky.
There are guys who argue that we altered the weather
as soon as we invented agriculture.)))</span></P>

<P>"What's more, many greens worry that just talking
about geoengineering could deflect funding and
focus from the task of cutting greenhouse gas
emissions. They'd rather we legislate higher
fuel-efficiency standards and design better
photovoltaics.  <span class="bluetext">((("Funding and focus"?
These guys don't know what a victory condition
looks like.  In the 2060s, damage from climate change
is supposed to outpace the planet's entire GNP.
That means ALL the funding and ALL the focus
get used up by one issue: climate crisis.)))</span></P>

<P>"Enviros are right about the urgency of kicking
the fossil fuel habit == that's a no-brainer.
The problem is inertia; the changes we have wrought
in the atmosphere will play out over decades
(or longer) whether we junk all the SUVs tomorrow
or not.  <span class="bluetext">(((Right.)))</span></P>

<P>"That's why it makes sense to start thinking seriously
about radical countermeasures.  <span class="bluetext">(((Well, no.
Logically, it ought to mean that it's time to start
WORKING seriously on radical long-term countermeasures
that take decades to carry out.  But I quibble:
come on, this is WIRED.  These are rock-solid
San Francisco  values getting an airing here.
On with the summer  of geoengineered love.)))</span></P>

<P>"One of the biggest boosts to the idea of climate
manipulation came last summer from Paul Crutzen, an
emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.
Writing in the journal Climate Change, Crutzen, who
shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in chemistry for work
examining ozone depletion, described a plan to shoot
massive quantities of sulfur into the stratosphere.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Paul Crutzen.  Nobel-Prize winning scientist.
Not a lunatic. Sane European guy.  Lives in world run
by lunatics; cannot be helped.  Note that Crutzen,
as a boy, almost starved to death in Holland in
the "Hunger Winter" of 1945 until the Swedes
dropped food out of the sky.  I think his proposal
possesses some moral gravity.)))</span><BR />

<P>"In theory, the sulfur would reflect sunlight == just
as particles blown into the air by the eruption of
Mount Pinatubo did in 1991 == cooling Earth and buying
enough time for civilization to shift into green gear.
<span class="bluetext">(((I shudder at the thought at what this
experiment would do to the weather, but at least we
do have the on-the-ground historical examples of
Pinatubo and Krakatoa to show that it doesn't destroy
the planet instantly.)))</span></P>

<P>"Crutzen's not crazy, and he's no renegade terraformer.
'Until a few years ago, I would also have been against
the idea,' he recently told an Australian newspaper.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((He's also stated elsewhere that he considers his
proposal to be a kind of interventionist publicity
stunt. "It was meant to startle the policy makers,"
said Paul J. Crutzen, of Germany's Max Planck Institute
for Chemistry. "If they don't take action much more
strongly than they have in the past, then in the end
we have to do experiments like this."   But Dr Paul's
an old man; it may well be that planetary policy-makers
thirty years from now consider geo-engineering to be
the only serious and practical option.)))</span></P>

<P>"His journal article == and his clout == gave
geoengineering an almost instant credibility boost.
Soon other heavies, like Ralph Cicerone, president of
the National Academy of Sciences, were also writing in
favor of the concept.</P>

<P>"Their message: Geoengineering isn't, and shouldn't be,
fringe science. 'Given that the climate-change problem
might be more serious than we previously thought,' says
Tom Wigley, a mathematical physicist at the National
Center for Atmospheric Research, 'we should consider
these radical solutions more seriously.'</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((He's got a point, so, here you go: geoengineering
is here in your email, consider it.)))</span></P>

<P>" Stanford's Caldeira is keeping an open mind == he's even helping to organize an 
international
geoengineering meeting at NASA Ames Research Center.</P>

<P>The shortsighted mistake here would be getting mired
in the details of these wild plans. (Crutzen's scheme
would mean we'd have to start loving smog == but
imagine the psychedelic sunsets!) Yes, these ideas
sound crazy. But we're in the earliest stages of
what is potentially the single most crucial new
science in history.</P>

<P>"Let's give the researchers a minute or two to get
their PowerPoint slides in order and, more important,
grab a slice of the admittedly modest budget for
climate-change research. Just remember: Advocating
the study of geoengineering does not mean campaigning
for the deployment of every ludicrous notion that
comes along.</P>

<P>"Smart people finally convinced us that we need to
stop burning fossil fuels. Let's do that. But because
what has already been set in motion tends to stay in
motion, we need a well-researched, measured plan to
get us (or, more realistically, our grandchildren)
out of this mess. The real worst-case scenario is
some kind of Bruce Willis-movie scheme deployed at
the eleventh hour, after the climate shift has
already hit the fan. == David Wolman</P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((What's the pitch in the sulfur cure, or as it's
described with a tad more dignity, the "Global Haze
Proposal?"  Giant balloons and giant guns.)))</span></P>

<P><br /><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061117/ap_on_sc/saved_by_haze">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061117/ap_on_sc/saved_by_haze</A></P>

<P>"The Dutch climatologist, awarded a 1995 Nobel in
chemistry for his work uncovering the threat to
Earth's atmospheric ozone layer, suggested that
balloons bearing heavy guns be used to carry
sulfates high aloft and fire them into the
stratosphere.</P>

<P>"While carbon dioxide keeps heat from escaping
Earth, substances such as sulfur dioxide, a common
air pollutant, reflect solar radiation, helping
cool the planet.</P>

<P>"Tom Wigley, a senior U.S. government climatologist,
followed Crutzen's article with a paper of his own
on Oct. 20 in the leading U.S. journal Science.
Like Crutzen, Wigley cited the precedent of the
huge volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the
Philippines in 1991.</P>


<P>"Pinatubo shot so much sulfurous debris into
the stratosphere that it is believed it cooled
the Earth by .9 degrees for about a year.
<span class="bluetext">(((Note that this cooling is not nine degrees, but
point-nine degrees.  Less than a degree.)))</span></P>


<P>"Wigley ran scenarios of stratospheric sulfate
injection == on the scale of Pinatubo's estimated
10 million tons of sulfur == through supercomputer
models of the climate, and reported that Crutzen's i
dea would, indeed, seem to work. Even half that
amount per year would help, he wrote.</P>


<P>"A massive dissemination of pollutants would be
needed every year or two, as the sulfates
precipitate from the atmosphere in acid rain."</P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((What do I like about the design of this Global
Haze scheme?)))</span></P>

It's been done before.  By volcanoes.

  If "Global Dimming" theory is right, we may
  already be doing "Global Haze" right now as we
  speak, except in a filthier and stupider way.

  It's got a volume dial.  You can spew a little

  more or less.

  It's cheap.  Bill Gates could do it out of the petty cash.

It isn't digital, so at least it doesn't
  run under Windows.
  <BR /><BR /></LI>

  <LI VALUE="9">
  It might distract the attention of governments
  from the much simpler and more elegant 'Global Haze"
  scheme, which would be to use ICBM rockets to spew
  chemical and biological dust over areas where
  people fail to share one's family values, thereby
  drastically reducing carbon emissions by the simple Stalinist tactic of eliminating us 
  all. "No people,
  no problem," as Kolya the Dread used to say.</LI>
