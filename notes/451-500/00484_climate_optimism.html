<P>"WHY FOOD AND ENERGY AS AN ISSUE?<br>
"Global food systems are not sustainable.
Industrialised  food consumes ten times more energy
in production and  distribution than enters our bodies
as nutrition.  In 'developed' countries, the food
consumption of a single family generates eight tonnes
of CO2 emissions a year. This madness is enabled by
non renewable fossil fuel. But what to do? Doors 9
breaks the food systems issue into bite-sized design
chunks."<BR>

<P>
"WHAT IS DOTT FOR?<BR>
"Two hundred and fifty regions in Europe (and many
more worldwide) are in search of a shared vision to
inspire economic and cultural renewal. In Dott 07,
the abstract idea of sustainability becomes a concrete
question: 'how do we want to live?' By the end of 2007,
some Dott 07 projects may evolve into enterprises;
people in the region will have learned, by doing it,
new approaches to social innovation; a further legacy will be platforms for ongoing social innovation &ndash;
 such as places, hubs, and support schemes.</P>

ECO-DESIGN CHALLENGE<BR>
Year eight students in 80 schools across the North
East of England have been invited to map their school's
'carbon footprint'. Having identified which aspects of
their school's systems and activities are wasteful,
they will soon propose the re-design of their school's
key systems to reduce its impact on the environment.
The 50 best schools will further develop their plans
with the help of professional designers. The best
designs will be eligible for awards at the Dott
Festival in October. If you would like to be considered
as one of those designers working with the schools
(as a volunteer) please contact project leader Nick
Devitt:<BR>

<P>STUFF-O-METER<BR>
How many materials are wasted during the manufacture
of a hairdryer? Or a car? Dott and Design and Art
Direction (D&amp;AD) have issued a challenge to
communication design students: Develop a Stuff-O-Meter'
to help us all understand more about the "hidden
rucksack" of everyday products. Competitors will
design a visual representation of the lifetime use of
material resources, from cradle to grave, of a
household durable product. The best designs will
be presented at the Dott Festival in October.
<span class="bluetext">(((Sounds like some kind of "spime dashboard,"
doesn't it?  Hope that project thrivesl!)))</span>

WILLIAM CALVIN<BR>
"The Climate Optimist"<BR>
by William Calvin<BR>
Professor, The University of Washington School of
Medicine; Author, <em>A Brain For All Seasons</em></P>

<P>Mention global warming at a seasonal social gathering
and see what happens, now that skepticism has turned
into concern and sorrow. They will assume that you're
a pessimist about our prospects. "Not really," I
protest. That earns me a quizzical look.</P>

<P>"Wait a minute," she says. "If you're an optimist,
why do you look so worried?"</P>

<P>"So you think it's easy, being an optimist?"</P>

<P>Many scientists look worried these days. We've had a
steady diet of bad news coming from climate scientists
and biologists. To become even a guarded optimist,
you have to think hard.</P>

<P>First, I reflected, the history of science and medicine
shows that, once you mechanistically understand what's
what, you can approach all sorts of seemingly
unsolvable problems. I'm optimistic that we will
learn how to stabilize climate.</P>

<P>Unfortunately the window of opportunity is closing.
Fifty years have now passed since the first unequivocal
scientific warnings of an insulating blanket of CO2
forming around the planet. Politicians apparently
decided to wait until something big went wrong.
<span class="bluetext">(((Politicians probably figured that politically managing
the weather and commanding the tides like Canute
was not within a politician's realm of expertise.
Of course, now that the climate's actually screwed
and the seas are literally rising, somebody's kinda
gotta. At least the politicians managed Kyoto, which
is more than industrialists, or the military, or
the intelligentsia ever managed to date.)))</span></P>

<P>It has. We have already entered the period of
consequences. Climate scientists have long been worried
about their children's future. Now they are also
worried about their own.  <span class="bluetext">(((This is some cause
for satisfaction, actually: we held our own feet
to the fire, and we won't simply export a doom that we
created to some hapless generation who had nothing
to do with it.)))</span></P>

<P>Our Faustian bargain over fossil fuels has come due. Dr. Faustus had 24 years of party-now, pay-later &ndash; and
 indeed, it's exactly 24 years since Ronald Reagan
axed the U.S. budget for exploring alternative fuels.
This led to doubling our use of cheap coal, the worst
of the fossil fuels. They're planning, under business as usual, to re-double coal burning by 2030 &ndash; even
 though we can now see the high cost of low price.
<span class="bluetext">(((I like it when these science writers wax all
literary and start quoting guys like Goethe.)))</span></P>

<P>The devil's helpers may not have come to take us away,
but killer heat waves have started, along with some
major complications from global warming. We're already
seeing droughts that just won't quit. Deserts keep
expanding. Oceans keep acidifying. Greenland keeps
melting. Dwindling resources keep triggering genocidal
wars with neighbors (think Darfur). Extreme weather
keeps trashing the place.<BR>
All of them will get worse before they get better.
<span class="bluetext">(((But wait!  It gets even more optimistic!)))</span></P>

<P>Worse, tipping points can lead to irreversible
demolition derbies. Should another big El Nino occur
and last twice as long as in 1983 or 1998, the profound
drought could burn down the rain forests in Southeast Asia and the Amazon &ndash; and half of all species could
 go extinct, just within a year or two.  <span class="bluetext">(((Do we
even have <STRONG>words</STRONG> for a cataclysm like that?  Yeah,
thanks to Jamais Cascio, we do now!)))</span></P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.openthefuture.com/2006/12/an_eschatological_taxonomy.html">http://www.openthefuture.com/2006/12/<br>an_eschatological_taxonomy.html</A>
Jamais Cascio's Eschatological Taxonomy</P>

<P>"Time has become so short that we must turn around
the CO2 situation within a decade to avoid saddling
our children with the irreversible consequences of a
runaway warming. That means not waiting for a better
deal on some post-Kyoto treaty. It means immediately
scaling up technologies that we know will work, not
waiting for something better that could take decades
to debug.</P>

<P>This isn't optional. It is something that we simply
have to do. The time for talk is past.</P>

<P>"I see why you're worried," she says. "But what's
your optimistic scenario for dealing with this fossil
fuel fiasco?"</P>

<P>For starters, I think it likely that the leaders of
the major religious groups will soon come to see
climate change as a serious failure of stewardship.
And once they see our present fossil fuel use as a
deeply immoral imposition on other people and unborn
generations, their arguments will trump the talk- endlessly-to-buy-time business objections &ndash; just as
 such moral arguments did when ending slavery in the
19th century. <span class="bluetext">(((Okay &ndash; so we get a giant swarm of fundies to
 help out?  I thought they'd been running the show since
Reagan.  What do they have to show in the way of
positive eco-accomplishments?   If religion
is supposed to be an answer, why don't they go
rebuild Jerusalem first?  Everybody agrees it's holy,
right?  A green, steward-centric, eco-ethical
Jerusalem.  Yeah, sure.  Okay, next optimistic
suggestion.)))</span></P>

<P>Second, the developed nations are fully capable of
kick-starting our response to global warming with present technology &ndash; enough to achieve, within ten
 years, a substantial reduction in their own fossil
fuel uses. How?</P>

<P>Wind farmers will prosper as pastures grow modern
windmills to keep the cows company.   <span class="bluetext">(((Okay.)))</span></P>

<P>Giant parking lots, already denuded of trees, are
perfect places for acres of solar paneling. Drivers
will love the shaded parking spaces they create.
<span class="bluetext">(((I'm buyin' it.  Sure.)))</span></P>

<P>The Carbon Tax will replace most of those deducted
from paychecks and create a big wave of retrofitting
homes and businesses. <span class="bluetext">(((I don't think this ought
to be called a "tax."  I think it ought to be called
something like "reparations for crimes against
humanity.")))</span></P>

<P>Big brightly lit grocery stores with giant parking
lots will compete poorly with warehouses that deliver
web and phone orders within the hour, like pizza.
<span class="bluetext">(((Hey, that's Wal_Mart you're dissing, Dr. Calvin.
They're already a lot greener than wood-oven
pizza joints.)))</span></P>

<P>Smaller neighborhood grocery stores will once again
do a big walk-in business and they will compete with
the warehouses by offering "green bicycle" delivery.
<span class="bluetext">(((Here in Serbia we've got a lot of these.  They're
called "kiosks."  They spring up and squat on
sidewalks right after abject economic collapse.
They're starting to go away now, mostly because
Belgrade has painfully advanced to the point of
creating real stores.)))</span></P>

<P>High-speed toll gates will become the norm on commuter
highways. (Yes, I know, but remember that the paycheck
was just enriched by eliminating withholding for income
tax.)  <span class="bluetext">(((All right, as long as green cars are
subsidized and don't have to pay.)))</span></P>

<P>Speed limits will be lowered to 50 mph (80 kmh) for
fuel efficiency and, as in 1973, drivers will marvel
at how smoothly the traffic flows. Double taxes will
apply to vehicles with worse-than-average fossil fuel
consumption, reducing the number of oversized vehicles
with poor streamlining. Hybrids and all-electric cars
will begin to dominate new car sales.  <span class="bluetext">(((Smoother
traffic flow would probably help more than the
55 mph limit, which everyone will ignore.)))</span></P>

<P>A firm, fast schedule will be established for retiring
or retrofitting existing coal plants. My bet is that adding nuclear power plants &ndash; France gets 78% of its
electricity that way, New Jersey 52%&ndash; will prove
 safer, cheaper, and faster than fixing coal.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, until the seas rise or rivers get spotty,
in which case nukes themselves succumb to climate
change because they lose their water coolant.)))</span></P>

<P>On the quarter-century time scale, let us assume that
the new rapid transit systems will reduce car commuting
by half.  <span class="bluetext">(((Or, you could just have 50 percent
unemployment, which would cut emissions just as
dramatically.)))</span>  The transition to electric and
hydrogen vehicles will shift transportation's energy
demands to greener sources, including biofuels,
geothermal, tidal, and wave generation.</P>

<P>The highly efficient binding energy extractors (BEEs,
the fourth-generation nuclear power plants) will be
running on the spent fuel of the earlier generations.
<span class="bluetext">(((Maybe.)))</span></P>

<P>The low-loss DC transmission lines will allow, via
cables under the Bering Strait, solar-generated
electricity to flow from the bright side to the dark
side of the earth.  <span class="bluetext">(((That would kinda rock, wouldn't
it?  Hope the Bering Strait behaves itself as the
ice melts.)))</span></P>

<P>And in this 25-year time frame, we ought to see some
important new technology making a difference, not
just improvements in what we already use. For example,
we might encourage rapid adaptation of the whale's
favorite food, the tiny phytoplankton which provide
half of the oxygen we breathe as they separate the
C from the CO2.  <span class="bluetext">(((Remediation.  Yeah, it's what's
for breakfast.  It's too late just to do less damage.
We've got to undo the damage already done.)))</span></P>

<P>Since the shell-forming plankton sink to the ocean
bottom when they die, their carbon is taken out of
circulation for millions of years. Forests can burn
down, releasing their stored carbon in a week, but
limestone is forever. <span class="bluetext">(((Makes a nice t-shirt.)))</span></P>

<P>If shell-forming plankton could thrive in warmer
waters with some selective breeding or a genetic
tweak, their numbers might double and start taking
our excess CO2 out of circulation.  <span class="bluetext">(((How do we
<STRONG>stop</STRONG> them?)))</span> But even if we invent‚ &ndash; and debug &ndash; such things tomorrow,
 it can take several decades before an invention makes
a dent in our urgent problem. And all this assumes
no bad surprises, such as the next supersized El
Nino killing off the Amazon and, once we lack all
those trees, increasing the rate of warming by half.</P>

<P>By mid-century, let us suppose that we have begun
extracting more CO2 from the atmosphere than we add.</P>

<P>This will only happen if the technology of the
developed world has become good enough to compensate
for what's still going on in the overstressed
nations that are too disorganized to get their
energy act together.  <span class="bluetext">(((Optimistically speaking,
maybe they're too disorganized to let their oil
companies buy their government, like the highly
organized Russians and Americans both did.)))</span></P>

<P>When CO2 levels fall enough to counter the delayed
warming from past excesses, we will begin to see a reversal of droughts and violent weather &ndash;
 though the rise in sea level will likely continue,
a reminder to future generations of our 20th-century
Faustian bargain.  <span class="bluetext">(((That would really be interesting,
though I find it hard to believe that a mid-21C sky with
carbon sucked out of it would fully  return to the status
quo ante.  Likely it would be a world with rather different weather patterns &ndash; especially
 if those seas keep rising anyhow.)))</span></P>

<P>As Samuel Johnson said in 1777, "when a man knows
he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates
his mind wonderfully."  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder if this made
Saddam Hussein an optimist.  It's also rather small
comfort that the vast majority of condemned prisoners
hang no matter how hard they think.)))</span> We need to turn on a dime &ndash; by which I mean, close
 to what we saw in the United States after the
bombing of Pearl Harbor.  <span class="bluetext">((("Khaki Green."
Yeah, several years of unrestrained mass slaughter
oughta concentrate minds pretty wonderfully.)))</span></P>

<P>From a standing start in late 1941, the automakers converted &ndash; in a matter of months, not years &ndash;
 more than 1,000 automobile plants across thirty-one
states... In one year, General Motors developed,
tooled, and completely built from scratch 1,000
Avenger and 1,000 Wildcat aircraft... GM also produced the amphibious 'duck' &ndash; a watertight steel
 hull enclosing a GM six-wheel, 2.5 ton truck that
was adaptable to land or water. GM's duck `was
designed, tested, built, and off the line in ninety
days'... Ford turned out one B-24 [a bomber] every
63 minutes. . . . &ndash; Jack Doyle, Taken for a Ride, 2000</P>

<P>Now there's a source of optimism: we did it before.
Indeed, GM currently needs a new purpose in life
(and I'd suggest repurposing the manned space program
as well). All of that talent is badly needed.</P>

<P>With great challenges come great opportunities and
I'm an optimist about our ability to respond with
innovation. Countries that innovate early will have
an economic edge over the laggards.</P>

<P>Our present civilization is like a magnificent
cathedral, back before flying buttresses were
retrofitted to stabilize the walls. Civilization
now needs a retrofit for stabilizing its foundations.
It will be a large undertaking, not unlike those
that once went into building pyramids and cathedrals.</P>

<P>I'm optimistic that the younger generation can create a better civilization during the major makeover &ndash;
 provided that those currently in the leadership
can stop this runaway coal train, real fast.
Climate change is a challenge to the scientists but
I suspect that the political leadership has the
harder task, given how difficult it is to make
people aware of what must be done and get them
moving in time.</P>

<P>It's going to be like herding stray cats, and the
political leaders who can do it will be remembered
as the same kind of geniuses who pulled off the
American Revolution.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I don't know which prospect is weirder: a world
of climate calamity where a swift holocaust devours
the Amazon and swamps London, or an amazingly
with-it and politically-together Global Green
Renaissance that saves our collective bacon in
ten years flat. I don't think anybody fully believes
in either of these prospects, not yet.  But they're
coming.  And they're coming fast.)))</span></P>
