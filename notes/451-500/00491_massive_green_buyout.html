<P><span class="bluetext">(((Now for the day's news, which is really kind of awe-inspiring in its suddenness and 
grandiosity.  First, enviro activists crow in victory, a sound one hasn't heard from their 
camp in some years:)))</span></P>

<P>**Breaking News**<BR>
<em>Victory in Texas ... Environmental Agreement Tied to Sale of Electricity Giant Will Block 
Construction of Eight Dirty Coal-Fired Power Plants</em></p>
<P>Dear Bruce,</P>

<P>Thanks to the generous support of our online activists and donors, today is a truly 
historic day in the fight against global warming.</P>

<P>News just broke that Texas Pacific Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. are 
seeking to acquire Texas-based energy giant TXU Corp.</P>

<P>As part of the sale agreement, Environmental Defense helped negotiate an aggressive 
environmental platform that will, among other things:</P>

<P>Terminate plans for the construction of 8 of 11 coal-fired power plants TXU had hoped 
to build; <span class="bluetext">(((They were planning to nail these coal-plants up in a panic rush and 
grandfather 'em in before Bush leaves power.)))</span></P>

<P>Stop TXU's plans to expand coal operations in other states;</P>

<P>Endorse the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) platform, including the call for a 
mandatory federal cap on carbon emissions; and</P>

<P>Reduce the company's carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.</P>

<P>Here's a story in The New York Times describing how Environmental Defense helped 
negotiate this deal:
<A HREF="http://action.environmentaldefense.org/ct/Vp16sGE1JX7B/">http://action.environmentaldefense.org/ct/Vp16sGE1JX7B/</A></P>

<P>This is a huge victory for the environmental community.
It sends a clear message about the undeniable momentum in our campaign calling for federal 
global warming legislation.  <span class="bluetext">(((I'm unclear on why these guys still want to waste time in federal legislation when they got their "historic victory" by hanging out with Corporate 
Green merger and acquisition financiers.  You'd think they'd blow off the Bush government 
and spend all their time with bankers, but, I dunno, old habits die hard.)))</span></P>


<P>The story behind today's announcement began last April when TXU announced alarming 
plans to build 11 dirty coal-fired power plants in Texas.  <span class="bluetext">(((Where else?  The whole state stinks!)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Except for the much-beleaguered CAPITAL of Texas, Austin, "the leading city in the nation in the fight against global warming"!)))</span> <A HREF="http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2007/02/05/daily26.html?surround=lfn">http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2007/02/05/daily26.html?surround=lfn</A></P>

<P>From the start, most business and political experts considered it a done deal. Texas 
Governor Rick Perry got personally involved, fast-tracking the permits and declaring 
"we're not going to let these bureaucrats jerk us around."  <span class="bluetext">(((Like most Governors of 
Texas including the current President, this guy is a consummate ignoramus.  Let's hope and 
pray he never does anything requiring any more effort and skill than being Governor of 
Texas.)))</span></P>


<P>Even our own experts in our Texas office considered the odds of stopping the plants as 
remote, at best.</P>

<P>But the size of the proposal left us no choice but to aggressively oppose the plants. 
The 11 coal-fired plants would spew 78 million tons of global warming pollution per year, 
more than twice the expected carbon reductions from the historic California Clean Cars 
legislation.</P>

<P>So, Environmental Defense mobilized an all-out grassroots campaign targeting TXU and 
Texas Governor Rick Perry. Nearly 50,000 Environmental Defense members and activists took 
action, sending emails, attending public hearings across Texas and submitting public 
comments against the plants.
More than 50 community and environmental groups signed on to our letter urging TXU to 
change its course.</P>


<P>We took out television, billboard and online ads.
We reached out to allies in the Texas state legislature and we worked the legal and 
financial angles to keep the pressure on TXU.</P>


<P>Our efforts were designed to achieve three goals:</P>

<OL type="1" start="1">
  <LI VALUE="1">
  Stop as many of the plants as possible;</LI>

  <LI VALUE="2">
  Prevent TXU from exporting its coal plant build-out to other states; and</LI>

  <LI VALUE="3">
  Send a national message to other utility companies that the TXU plan is one they should 
  reject.
  <span class="bluetext">(((Those companies are listening -- not to the activists, of course, but to guys with 
  enough muscle to buy fossil-fuel companies after the activists wear down the stock price a 
  little.)))</span></LI>

</OL>

<P>It may have been a long shot when we started this campaign, but this weekend's news 
meets each of these goals.  <span class="bluetext">(((I like it when a guy is smart enough to declare victory and 
actually stop the
war.)))</span></P>

<P>I want to thank everyone who took action on this campaign and supported our work with 
generous donations or other actions. We couldn't have claimed this seemingly unattainable 
victory without your support.</P>

<P>Thanks for everything you help make possible,</P>

<P>Fred Krupp<BR>
President</P>

<P>
<span class="bluetext">(((Now the New York Times weighs in.  Note that Krupp cites their article, so he must more 
or less agree with their assessment. At least, Krupp was clearly a source.)))</span></P>

<P><em>A Buyout Deal That Has Many Shades of Green</em></P>

<P>By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN<BR>
Published: February 26, 2007</P>

<P>About two weeks ago, Fred Krupp, the president of a nonprofit advocacy group called 
Environmental Defense, received an unusual phone call.</P>

<P>William K. Reilly, the former administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency 
under President George H. W. Bush, was on the other end. But before Mr. Reilly would 
explain the reason for his call, he said he needed an assurance from Mr. Krupp that he 
would keep the conversation confidential.</P>

<P>After receiving such a pledge, Mr. Reilly dropped a bombshell: the TXU Corporation, the 
Texas energy giant that had become the whipping boy of the nation's largest environmental 
groups, was in talks to be sold to a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company a 
nd Texas Pacific Group, two large private equity firms.</P>

<P>Mr. Reilly, who works for Texas Pacific, said he wanted to negotiate a cease-fire. If 
the investors succeeded in taking over TXU, Mr. Reilly said, they would commit themselves 
to scale back significantly on TXU's plan to build 11 new coal plants and adhere to a 
strict set of environmental rules. <span class="bluetext">(((The guy is, after all, the former head of the 
EPA.)))</span></P>

<P>In return, he wanted the support of Mr. Krupp and his peers, who had spent the past 
several months waging a bitter and public war against TXU.</P>

<P>Early Monday, after several weeks of marathon negotiations that brought together both 
environmentalists and Wall Street bankers, TXU announced that its board of directors had 
approved the bid from Kohlberg Kravis and Texas Pacific for about $45 billion, which would 
be the largest buyout in history.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((And the evil genius who proposed building all the coal plants REMAINS IN POWER.  
That's the genius of it.  In fact, since TXU capo C. John Wilder owns a ton of TXU stock, 
he's gonna clear millions of dollars.  The brilliance of this scheme?  You don't actually 
have to buy companies.  You just have to bribe the CEO elite and they'll sell out the 
enterprise, hook, line and sinker!)))</span></P>


<P>The deal was noteworthy not just for its size, but for the confluence of business 
decisions and environmental concerns that drove the ultimate transaction. <span class="bluetext">(((Call it 
"Corporate Green.")))</span></P>

<P>Because private equity firms are unregulated and historically have valued their privacy,
 neither Kohlberg Kravis nor Texas Pacific were eager to become an "enemy combatant" of 
the environmental groups, people involved in the talks said. Reducing the coal plant 
initiative will also free up billions of dollars in planned spending that the firms will 
be able to use for other projects or to help finance the transaction.  <span class="bluetext">(((Corporate Green 
"values its privacy" because it is basically covertly doing what governments used to do 
back when governments actually governed.  Why run the EPA when you can just buy coal 
plants?)))</span></P>

<P>Within TXU, the controversial plan to build a raft of coal plants had become so 
damaging to its stock price that its board had been privately weighing a plan to scrap 
part of the project, said people involved in the talks, <span class="bluetext">(((note that Krupp is willing to 
talk publicly to the NY Times, while Corporate Green raiders stay off the record)))</span> 
bringing the number of new  plants to 5 or 6 from 11. Shareholders had sent the stock on a 
roller coaster ride from more than $67 a share to as low as about $53  <span class="bluetext">(((that's not much 
of a roller-coaster; consider Enron)))</span> over concerns about the risk and vast expenditure; 
the stock closed at $60.02 on Friday.
</P>

<P>Indeed, it was the quick drop in TXU's stock price that got the attention of Kohlberg 
Kravis and Texas Pacific, which look for undervalued companies and try to turn them 
around.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Carbon companies will be henceforth subjected to organized under-valuement.  Their 
captains of industry will be bought off and then they'll be annihilated.  Watch it 
happen.)))</span></P>

<P>Together, both firms approached C. John Wilder, TXU's chief executive, in January with 
an offer for the company, these people said.</P>

<P>At the time, neither Kohlberg Kravis nor Texas Pacific told TXU about their ambition to 
scale back its controversial coal plants. But behind the scenes, both firms had been 
developing a new strategy for the company with the help of Goldman Sachs, their lead 
adviser.</P>

<P>Goldman Sachs has been a longtime proponent of reducing carbon emissions. Its former 
chief executive, Henry M. Paulson, now the secretary of the treasury, was also the 
chairman of the Nature Conservancy, an environmental activist group.</P>

<P>Texas Pacific's co-founder, David Bonderman, is member of the board of the World 
Wildlife Fund, and Mr. Reilly is chairman emeritus. Mr. Bonderman called Mr. Reilly to 
help work on the deal and create what they ultimately called The Green Group, a committee 
of advisers that included Mr. Reilly, Roger Ballentine of Green Strategies and Stuart E. 
Eizenstat, the former chief domestic policy adviser for President Jimmy Carter.  <span class="bluetext">((("The 
Green Group."  Yikes.)))</span></P>


<P>"We didn't want to be on the wrong side of history,"
said a person involved in the bidding group who was not authorized to talk about the 
transaction before its formal announcement. <span class="bluetext">((("We also didn't want to be quoted in 
public.")))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Fascinated by weird Texas energy politics?  Read your fill!)))</span>
<A HREF="http://www.texasobserver.org/blog/?cat=7">http://www.texasobserver.org/blog/?cat=7</A></P>

<P>Under the terms of the deal, TXU shareholders will receive $69.25 in cash for each TXU 
share. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Citigroup will take small stakes 
in TXU as well as help finance the debt with J.P. Morgan Chase. In addition, the investor 
group will assume more than $12 billion of TXU's debt.</P>

<P>The deal represents a 20 percent premium over TXU's closing price on Thursday before 
word of the deal began to leak and was reported Friday on CNBC after the market closed, 
TXU said.</P>


<P>It is unclear whether shareholders will agitate for a higher price from the investor 
group or push for other suitors to emerge. Several recent "go private"
deals have drawn opposition from shareholders who expressed concern that they were being 
shortchanged.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah?  Then how come they pay CEOs so much?
The shareholders are gluttons for punishment.)))</span></P>

<P>Monday's merger agreement allows TXU's board to solicit bids from other potential 
buyers through April 16, and TXU said it intends to do so.
<span class="bluetext">(((It'll be interesting to see if any black angel investors show up and INSIST on building 
coal plants.)))</span></P>

<P>The investor group has not laid out any specific plans to grow revenues through 
alternatives to the coal plants, but TXU is not likely to lose money, at least initially, 
as a result of scaling back.
Three of the plants are already in the works and other eight that will be canceled would 
not have been built for years.</P>

<P>And the group will be getting more than just a utility. TXU is in the midst of an 
experiment to run broadband Internet over its power lines as part of a venture with 
Current Communications.
<span class="bluetext">(((Very Enron. They loved Internet pipes.)))</span></P>

<P>Both TXU, which was advised by Credit Suisse and Lazard, and the investor group spent 
weeks holed up in three conference rooms at the Gaylord Texan, a hotel just outside of 
Dallas. With armies of bankers and lawyers that frequently numbered more than 40, the 
group negotiated the buyout deal, including an unusual provision that will allow TXU to 
seek higher rival bids over the next 50 days.
This clause could potentially create a bidding war, perhaps bringing other private equity 
firms and utilities into an auction.</P>

<em>Deal's Broader Effect on Coal Plants Is Uncertain (February 26, 2007) </em> <span class="bluetext">(((uncertain, but 
they've gotta be wondering today)))</span></P>

<P>Mr. Bonderman and Henry R. Kravis, the founder of Kohlberg Kravis, pleaded their case 
to the Texas governor, Rick Perry, on Thursday in person at his mansion, mindful that 
Oregon had rejected Texas Pacific&acirc;€™s deal to buy Portland General and that Arizona 
had rejected Kohlberg Kravis' deal to buy UniSource Energy. The pair has also reached out 
to James A. Baker, a Texan and former Reagan cabinet member.  <span class="bluetext">(((James A. Baker, "the Bush 
Consigliere.")))</span></P>

<P>But perhaps the most difficult talks were with the environmentalists, who often seemed 
more like Wall Street negotiators than green activists.  <span class="bluetext">(((Given that government is a 
non-player, these self-appointed activists barging into the boardroom are the only thing 
standing between the citizenry and outright corporate-green feudalism.  It's no wonder 
they've finally learned to act like businessmen when business is the only game in town.)))</span>
</P>

<P>Mr. Krupp of Environmental Defense used his conversation with Mr. Reilly as an 
opportunity to negotiate even harder for further concessions. The men agreed that Mr. 
Krupp's lieutenant, James D.
Marston, who was leading the charge against TXU in Texas, would meet with Mr. Reilly and 
other representatives of the buying group. And representatives from Natural Resource 
Defense Council, another climate-control advocacy group, was brought into the discussion 
to help formulate a plan that all sides could agree on.</P>

<P>So last Wednesday, Mr. Marston flew to San Francisco, <span class="bluetext">(((obligatory "oh look, the 
enviros are flying in airplanes and spewing carbon" riff inserted here)))</span> where he found 
himself face to face with Mr.
Reilly over breakfast at the Mandarin Oriental hotel.
There, over scrambled eggs and croissants, Mr.
Reilly laid out a plan that included reducing the coal plants from 11 to 3.</P>

<P>Then the men went to Texas Pacific's conference room overlooking Alcatraz and the San 
Francisco Bay for a day-long negotiation that stretched until early the next morning. The 
group, which included Mr.
Reilly, Mr. Bonderman and Frederick Goltz of Kohlberg Kravis, worked out a "10-point plan" 
that included a commitment by the investors to return the carbon- dioxide emissions by TXU 
to 1990 levels by 2020 and support a $400 million energy efficiency program.
<span class="bluetext">(((Okay, this is the actual work of the world being performed here.  This is the sound of 
icebergs not melting, seas not rising, etc.
Let 'em get after it, don't get in the way.)))</span></P>

<P>When an agreement was finally struck, at 1 a.m.
the next morning, Mr. Reilly grabbed a bottle of pinot noir from his colleague's office to 
toast the group. But he couldn't find a corkscrew.
<span class="bluetext">(((Need more tech geeks in the boardroom.
I'm only a damn author and I've got a Swiss Army corkscrew right here.)))</span> So he ran back 
to the Mandarin Oriental to borrow one.  <span class="bluetext">(((Let's be charitable, maybe their corkscrews 
were confiscated by airline security.)))</span></P>

<P>Not all of TXU's historical opponents are popping corks. Some noted that a decision by 
one company did not sway the others that are building plants.
In Dallas, Laura Miller, the mayor and leader of a coalition of municipal officials that 
has spent $600,000 fighting the TXU plants, said the agreement with the environmental 
groups might not get TXU as much help as it wanted.</P>

<P>Ms. Miller pointed out that one of the three surviving projects, a plant near Waco, is 
still opposed by local officials and had drawn a negative recommendation from a panel of 
Texas judges. She said she hoped that TXU's plans would leave an opening for cleaner 
projects, like a proposal to build a power line to West Texas, where power producers 
propose to build large wind farms.
