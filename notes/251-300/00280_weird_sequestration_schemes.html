<P>"Scientists are developing technologies to trap and store<BR>
carbon dioxide — but there are risks, says Vanessa<BR>

<BR>

<P>"As ministers argue over the finer points of the Kyoto
Protocol on climate change in Marrakech this week, some
researchers are considering a radically different solution
to the problem.
</P>

<P>"They are seeking methods of trapping and storing the
carbon dioxide emitted from burning fossil fuels, as a
means of postponing fundamental changes in the way energy
is generated and used.
</P>

<P>"Some of the more futuristic proposals have included
injecting dust into the stratosphere, 'greening' the
deserts, creating artificial reefs of genetically
engineered algae and building giant insulated balls of dry
ice. (((One has to wonder how and when the term
"futuristic" became a synonym for "far-fetched.")))
</P>

<P>"Other suggestions are less eye-catching but not much
less ambitious. Interest in the topic has been stimulated
by the US administration's search for alternative methods
of tackling climate change, following its rejection of the</P><!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Kyoto Protocol.  ((("We're already behaving like lunatics<BR>
— so roll in those giant balls of dry ice!")))<BR>
<BR>
"'We all believe technology offers great promise<BR>
significantly to reduce emissions — especially carbon<BR>
capture, storage and sequestration technologies,' said<BR>
President George W. Bush in May. (((Okay, grant 'em this<BR>
much — it beats treating the atmosphere as a sewer.)))</P><!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"In 1999, a US Department of Energy report listed
potential benefits from carbon sequestration, ranging from
new materials to improved agricultural practices. The
approach was 'truly radical in a technology context', it
said.
</P>

<P>"In July, the DoE announced plans to spend $25m on
studying methods of capturing carbon gases and storing
them in underground geological formations or in
terrestrial vegetation such as forests. Its goal is to
develop sequestration that costs $10 or less per tonne of
carbon, about 30 times less than many current options.
((("Plans" to spend "25 million?"  Oh!  For a minute we
thought you really meant it.)))
</P>

<P>"Forests gradually absorb carbon from the air. But
for most carbon storage techniques, the carbon dioxide
must be captured immediately after combustion. Techniques
are already available: carbon dioxide can be absorbed from
gas streams by contact with solvents and activated
materials or by being passed through special membranes.
</P>

<P>"Other techniques are under development. One proposal
involves an 'oxy-fuel' boiler developed by Praxair, in New
York.</P>

  actual products.
  <A HREF="http://www.praxair.com">http://www.praxair.com</A>
  <BR>
  </DD></DL>

<P>"The boiler uses a membrane to separate oxygen from
other gases in air. When this burns it produces a
concentrated carbon dioxide exhaust, which is relatively</P><!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>easy to capture. (((Gotta be a civilian app here somewhere<BR>
— maybe you can build 'em into birthday candles.)))</P><!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"Some researchers think the carbon dioxide removed in
this way could be recovered and transformed into
commercial products, such as plastics and rubbers, that
are inert and long-lived. (((Dump the trash into consumer
products!)))  A 1999 Department of Energy report
speculated carbon could find a new market in ultra-light
vehicles made from advanced composite materials. (((Make
even more cars with the smut!)))
</P>

<P>"But most approaches simply involve storing carbon
dioxide. One popular line of research involves injecting
carbon dioxide into oilfields. Work commissioned by the
International Energy Agency estimates that depleted
oilfields could store 126bn tonnes of carbon dioxide.
(((After all, oil fields,  that's where a lot of it came</P><!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>from.))) Because injecting carbon dioxide enhances the<BR>
recovery of oil — about 70 oilfields worldwide already<BR>
use the technique — this may even become a source of<BR>
profit. (((Use the smut to squeeze out more smut and burn<BR>
that too!)))</P><!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"Another possibility is locking up carbon dioxide
permanently by making it react with naturally occuring
mineral oxides to form carbonates, thereby avoiding the
need for underground reservoirs.  (((Turn it into big
rocks!))) But according to the IEA, this approach would
cost at least $62 per tonne of carbon dioxide. (((One
wonders how much a ton of airborne carbon dioxide costs us
in weather damage.  Big rocks for $62 a tonne, that
doesn't sound too bad...  maybe you can build giant
weatherproof bunkers with them.)))
</P>

<P>"Another avenue of research concerns the ability of
carbon dioxide, under certain conditions, to form stable
hydrate molecules. These are similar to the methane
hydrates thought to occur in large quantities under the
sea and in permafrost regions.  (((At least, hydrates
occurred there until the sea and the permafrost started
<STRONG>warming up.</STRONG>))) But estimated costs exceed $500 per tonne
of carbon dioxide, the IEA says.
</P>

<P>"Storing carbon in trees and agricultural land is a</P><!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>cheaper and better-understood approach to sequestration.<BR>
Attempts to improve the storage of these land sinks —<BR>
which currently store about 40 per cent of man-made carbon<BR>
dioxide emissions — are encouraged under the Kyoto<BR>
Protocol. (((Especially if you are Russia — sell lots of<BR>
oil, underprice OPEC, and plant trees right into that<BR>
thawing permafrost!)))</P><!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>"But the issue is controversial, not least because
much of the carbon stored by growing trees will later be
released. In a cautious report issued this year, the Royal
Society warned that planting new forests could even prove
counter-productive. Rising temperatures could kill off the
forests, releasing their carbon to the atmosphere over a
relatively short period. (((Like, if these forests catch
fire wholesale in greenhouse droughts, Indonesia and
Mexico-style.)))
</P>

<P>(...)  "Many of the concerns about storing carbon on
land also apply to proposals for storing carbon dioxide in
the deep oceans. (((Drown the stuff!)))  In principle, the
deep oceans have an enormous capacity to store carbon
dioxide, because the high alkalinity of seawater means it
is largely stored as carbonate ions. Currently, the oceans
remove about 30 per cent of the annual carbon dioxide
emissions produced by man, according to CSIRO, the
Australian research organisation. (((Put it on shore and
have the warming oceans rise up and swallow it.)))
</P>

<P>"Researchers seeking to increase the storage capacity
of oceans are examining two main options: injecting carbon
dioxide into the deep sea; and increasing the uptake of
carbon by marine phytoplankton by adding iron and other
nutrients to the ocean. (((Turn the coal into seething
ocean goo.)))
</P>

<P>"But there may be risks.  (((Really?))) Last month in
Science, the international science journal, US researchers
called for more research on the possible biological
effects of deep-sea carbon dioxide sequestration. Deep-sea
animals may be highly sensitive to environmental changes
in carbon dioxide concentration and acidity, they said.
(((An interesting objection, given that half the coral
reefs are dying from greenhouse heat right now.)))
</P>

<P>"Another concern stems from the possibility that
stored carbon may suddenly be released.  (((The Fizzing
Coke Can scenario.))) The danger was illustrated in 1986.
More than 1,700 people living near the shores of Lake Nyos
in Cameroon were asphyxiated after a plume of carbon
dioxide bubbled up from the bottom of the lake. (((More
Involuntary Parks.)))
</P>

<P>"Even if stored carbon dioxide leaked from the ground
or ocean without causing immediate damage, its impact on
the climate could be highly damaging. 'Unless the prospect
of uncontrolled release of carbon dioxide can be
demonstrated to be unrealistic, sequestration may prove
unacceptable,' according to research by the IEA reporting
that after 50 or more years, leakage of only 1 per cent a</P><!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>year could amount to more than 1bn tonnes of carbon<BR>
released to the atmosphere annually. (((Aw come on — 50<BR>
years from now?  Who cares?  There's 9 billion of 'em.)))</P><!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>"Many environmental campaigners oppose research of
this sort. 'The global climate is a highly non-linear
system determined by complex feedback processes and we
still have a poor understanding of how it works. Any
attempt deliberately to tinker with this system could
backfire very badly,' says Ben Matthews, an environmental
activist. (((But Ben, dude, there's no status quo ante
left.  We're already way, way into tinkerdom.)))
</P>

<P>"For many environmental campaigners, a technological
'fix' to allow continued consumption of fossil fuels is
anathema. It is analogous, they say, to running down our
kidneys to the state where we have to be permanently
attached to a dialysis machine. ((("No kidneys left?
Tough luck!  We never researched that!  Woulda been
anathema!"))) At the least, the possibility of dealing
with carbon emissions could distract politicians from the
need to improve energy efficiency and renewable
technologies. (((Not as distracted as they are by
ExxonMobil with a wheelbarrow full of cash, though.)))
</P>——

<P>"There is, indeed, a risk that advanced carbon
sequestration techniques could lull the world into a false
sense of security.  (((What's supposed to lull us out of
that?)))  But if the climate change problem becomes
overwhelming, we shall need all the help we can get."</P>

<P>(((Yes, those schemes are ludicrous, and they've got no
political will or market push behind them anyway, but
you know, we Viridians have cheerfully publicized even
stranger things.)))</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Topic:    Mirrors &amp; Smoke, and Other Shady Schemes</P>

  <P>Speaker:  Robert G. Kennedy III, PE</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>President, The Ultimax Group, Inc.</P>

<P>Stanford University</P>

<P>Computer Systems Laboratory Colloquium
4:15PM, Wednesday, November 14, 2001
Gates Computer Science Building
NEC Auditorium, Room B03</P>

<P>About the talk:</P>

<P>390,000 sq.km of solar sails, placed in non-Keplerian
orbits around the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrange point, can
intercept enough (~0.25%) sunlight to offset global
warming and concomitant rapid climate change due to
anthropogenic CO2, or if you will, a mirrored Maunder
Minimum. Such mirrors can also provide total planetary
electricity demand, estimated at 300 quads (quadrillion
BTUs) by 2050, displacing all terrestrial carbon-burners.</P>


<P>The capital cost of solar sails is at least an order of
magnitude less than the sum of economic, social, and
environmental damages/externalities due to unmitigated
climate change over the next century, rough order of
magnitude (ROM) estimate US$200 trillion in 1999 dollars.
The capital cost may also be less than the already
budgeted replacement/expansion cost of the world's energy
generation plant (ROM est. US$20 trillion through 2050).</P>


<P>This world-saving concept is:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>scalable (twice the mirror produces twice the 
        effect), 
 

  <LI>uncoupled (each mirror works independently of 
        the others), 
 

  <LI>incremental (pay as you go with immediate 
        benefit), 
 

  <LI>unobtrusive (umbra does not reach Earth, so the 
        sails are essentially invisible), and finally 
 

  <LI>reversible (sails can be moved off-axis to restore
  insolation).</LI>

</UL>

<P>Who should attend? Students interested in:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>advanced control systems, 
 

  <LI>energy generation and transmission, 
 

  <LI>physical optics, 
 

  <LI>orbital dynamics, 
 

  <LI>engineering economics, 
 

  <LI>systems science, and 
 

  <LI>climate change issues and public policy.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Basic models will be used to demonstrate the concepts and
a short CG animation prepared for European broadcast
television will be shown.</P>
