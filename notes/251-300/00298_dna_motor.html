<P>"Morphing DNA makes motor</P>

<P>By Kimberly Patch 
<BR></P>

<P>"(...) Researchers at New York University have taken a
significant step forward (...)
<BR></P>

<P>"The researchers demonstrated the mechanism by making a
four-step rotary motor out of DNA. (((What fresh hell is
this?)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The motor is a four-stranded DNA molecule that,
prompted by separate strands of DNA, will go through a
mechanical cycle over and over again. Because the process
is a reversible cycle, there are no waste products.
(((It's DNA. It's a motor.  It doesn't pollute.  Oh my
goodness.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The four-stranded DNA molecule is essentially a pair
of double helixes of DNA connected at several points along
their lengths.  When the researchers add molecules of
control DNA to a solution full of the motor molecules, the
short, single-stranded control molecules join with the
larger molecules and rearrange them by connecting two of
the double strands in one place and cutting them in
another.
<BR></P>

<P>"The researchers then remove the control strands using
fuel strands of DNA, which are also short single-stranded
lengths of DNA. This leaves the motor molecule in a
different physical shape than when it started == the end
of one double strand of the DNA is rotated 180 degrees
relative to the strands next to it. (((So you've got to
dunk the whole mechanical DNA mess into its "fuel" == but
then it neatly warps and unwarps.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The process can be reversed by adding a different type
of control strand to the solution, and that control strand
can also be removed by a different type of fuel strand
after it changes the molecule back. 'The system can be
cycled numerous times... and there are no breakdown
products,' said Nadrian Seeman, a chemistry professor at
New York University.
<BR></P>

<P>"The process can be adapted to many different sequences
of DNA, said Seeman. 'Many different species of this
device can be made by changing the sequences in the region
where the... strands bind,' he said. (((For instance,
consider the human DNA that gave you opposable, twiddling
thumbs.  I reckon we could goose that stuff up to eight,
nine hundred RPM.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"This means a wide range of similar rotary devices can
be created by changing the fuel strands and the places
where they bind, he said. Ten different molecules can
result in 1,024 different structures, for instance.
<BR></P>

<P>"The researchers are currently working on a method to
insert the DNA devices into molecular lattices, said
Seeman. (((DNA engine blocks.))) This would enable still
more structures. An array of four by four molecules, for
instance, could produce 65,536 different shapes. 'This may
enable us to build nanofabrication facilities to produce
new molecular species,' he said. (((How about making
classical Turing machines out of 'em?  We can compute by
sliding long tapes made of gattaca!)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The range of motion the molecular motors can produce
ranges from .04 to 4 nanometers, but the researchers have
produced motions as large as 35 nanometers using arrays,
according to Seeman. A nanometer is one millionth of a
millimeter. On this scale, an E. coli bacterium is a
relative giant, with a girth of 1 micron, or 1,000
nanometers. A line of ten carbon atoms measures about one
nanometer. (((Vroom!)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The research is 'great stuff,' said Erik Winfree, an
assistant professor of computer science and computation
and neural systems at the California Institute of
Technology. The method is a step forward in terms of DNA
mechanics, he said. 'It expands our toolbox for designing
molecular machines.'  (((A veritable galaxy of mischief
here.  Paging Al Qaeda.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The research is ultimately aimed at making
nanorobotics practical, according to Seeman. 'It could be
used to configure a molecular pegboard or control
molecular assemblers. The ability to achieve many
different shapes means that you can create many different
patterns; different patterns in a timed sequence are the
essence of a machine or robot,' he said. (((Nanofreaks
always want to make those goofy little Foresight Institute
nanorobots.  If you've got nonpolluting DNA that twists on
command when you wash it, why not just use <STRONG>that</STRONG> as your
design material?  It's a room temperature, wriggling,
molecular pegboard.  Make clothes out of it.  Make shoes.
Make laundry soap.  Forget the imaginary robots.  Come
on.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Molecular machines could be used to assemble drugs
molecule-by-molecule, and molecular robots may eventually
work inside the human body. (((Yeah, sure.  "Body by
Chrysler."  Who do you sue when those things crash and
break down?)))
<BR></P>

<P>"It will be about a decade before the method can be
used to make practical devices, said Seeman.
<BR></P>

<P>"Seeman's research colleagues were Hao Yan, Xiaoping
Zhang and Zhiyong Shen. They published the research in the
January 3, 2002 issue of Nature. The research was funded
by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Office of Naval
Research (ONR), the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA)."</P>
