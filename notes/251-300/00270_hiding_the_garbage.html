<P>"Nuclear waste recyclers target consumer products</P>

<P>"NEW YORK == Orthodontists could soon be giving their
patients more than they bargained for with their brand new
braces: a mouthful of radioactive waste.   (((Hey, nice
hook!)))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under a Department of Energy plan, braces aren't
the only product which could contain radioactive waste.
Zippers, lawn chairs, hip replacements and countless other
consumer products could include trace amounts of waste
taken from nuclear reactors or weapons complexes and
recycled into scrap metal.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Department of Energy (DOE) sees the recycling as
a way to clean up waste at decommissioned nuclear plants
and weapons facilities, but environmental groups call the
idea ridiculous.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'It's hard to imagine a nuclear enterprise more tone
deaf to public concerns or a more cockamamie scheme than
taking radioactive waste and disposing of it in consumer
products,' said Dan Hirsch, president of nuclear watchdog
group Committee to Bridge the Gap.  (((No it isn't.
That's not hard to imagine at all.   Because it's been
happening since 1945, quite without human intention.)))</P>

<P>(...)
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Critics say recycling radioactive waste, even at low
levels, is reckless. But energy officials say that the
government needs to look at all options for getting rid of
the growing pile of hazardous wastes. Proponents of the
plan say that by spreading small, non-lethal amounts into
recycled scrap, the need for large waste dumps could be
avoided.   (((Wait a minute == here's a great scheme.
Let's recycle all of that metal waste into big, metal-
hungry SUVs.  Then only rich people == a tiny fraction of
the planet's population! == will suffer exposure!)))</P>

<P>"CONCERN IS HEALTHY
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A moratorium was placed on radioactive recycling
last year by former Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson
after environmental groups protested the possible sale of
6,000 metric tons of contaminated nickel from the energy
department's Oakridge nuclear facility in Tennessee to
scrap metal dealers.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But under the Bush administration, the program is
being revisited and the energy department is considering
lifting the moratorium. But before that, it is required by
law to conduct a thorough study on the safety risks of
recycling radioactive waste.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The proposal does not specify any uses for scrap
metal containing the radioactive waste, but metal industry
executives say the material would go into the supply of
scrap metal and could be used to make anything.
(((Include it in "anything," the good ol' StarLink corn
gambit!  Ideally, these shiny nickel radwaste consumer
goods should be promoted as having tremendous cachet, in
some distant market where they're short on geiger
counters.  The Congo, maybe.  They'd be a definite bargain
if their shelf price was subsidized by the disposal
costs.)))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even the study has proven problematic. The DOE
recently dropped Science Applications International Corp.
(SAIC) == which it initially chose to conduct the study
and prepared a report == because of its business
partnership with British Nuclear Fuels Limited, the
company that last year was going to contract with the
government to help sell the waste from the Oakridge
facility.  (((There, see!  Hire those SAIC guys!  They're
up for it!)))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hirsch of the Committee to Bridge the Gap said it
was an enormous potential conflict of interest.  SAIC's
report 'is quite dangerous in terms of arguing how much
radioactivity would be acceptable for use in consumer
products.'
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The energy department has not said who was hired to
complete the study, but some are arguing that the level of
radiation in any recycled materials would be too low to
actually pose a health risk.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association
representing some 260 companies in the nuclear power
industry, has lobbied in favor of radioactive recycling
and says the public may be overly concerned.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Concern is healthy,' said Felix Killar, director
of material licenses for the institute. 'But people need
to understand the facts. This isn't truly radioactive
waste. It's no more radioactive than any other material
recycled in to consumer products.'
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Killar continues: 'There isn't a place on Earth
that is totally free of radioactivity.'  (((And Mr. Felix
Killar (how on earth did they hire a guy with that name?)
is dead right, you know.  Radon is perfect natural, it's a
serious radiation contaminant, and a few spare thousand
metric tons of slightly soiled nickel here and there, is
no big deal.  There's a hitch in this scheme, though.
Oversight.  The biotech industry claims that it's
cripplingly expensive to keep American GMO products out of
Europe's food-supply.  That's stuff we <STRONG>eat.</STRONG>   What set
of regulatory geniuses is going to be telling us how much
trash radioactivity is in our steel?  Steel is an ultimate
commodity.)))</P>

<P>"A LITTLE RADIATION IS OK
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"John Wittenborn, attorney for the Metal Industries
Recycling Coalition (MIRC), comprised of a variety of
metal industry trade groups, says their polls indicate the
public doesn't buy the idea that nuclear waste can be
safely recycled into everyday products. (((But wait ==
aluminum cans could have a little recycle-arrow logo <STRONG>and</STRONG>
a radiation logo, both at the same time!)))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We've spent a lot of time and effort to build the
perception that products made from recycled materials are
safe and good and that recycling itself is something that
society should be in favor of,' said Wittenborn, whose
group strongly opposes recycling of radioactive waste into
scrap metal.  ((("Scrap-Metal Junkmen == Your First Line
of Defense In Environmental Protection.")))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beyond the public image problem the industry would
face in using the recycled waste, companies are concerned
about the potential contamination of their mills and
workers.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wittenborn says it can cost from $5 million to $15
million to shut down, inspect by hand and then clean a
steel mill that has registered radioactivity above a
background level. (((Who scraps the scrappers?)))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recently, Wittenborn attended an energy department
public hearing on the issue in Crystal City, Virginia
where he presented his polling data and the metal
industry's case.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, those who have attended the hearings say
most of the comments have opposed lifting the moratorium
on radioactive recycling.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The observer might ask 'Why does the DOE continue
to propose to do this if no one is willing to come forward
and testify on behalf of it?'" said Dan Guttman, executive
director of President Clinton's Advisory Committee on
Human Radiation Experiments.  (((Why does no one testify?
Because they feel much safer in the dark, of course.  Just
having this become a public issue constitutes defeat.
"Scrap steel for sale, $25 a ton == $50 a ton if you watch
us make it.")))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'This is being cast as a question of convincing the
hysterical public that a little radiation is OK.'
(((Well, hysteria's no use.  If a little radiation was
enough to wipe us out, Chernobyl wouldn't be a wildlife
park.  And one more thing.  Steel <STRONG>already</STRONG> has radiation
in it, thanks to nuclear testing.  There's already a
recycling industry which is dedicated to <STRONG>clean</STRONG> steel
from historical sources, before the days of fission.
Every heard of that recycling industry?  Look!)))</P>

<P>"Section G.7: Salvage of German WWII U-Boats
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1995 it was announced that about 100 German WWII
U-boats would be salvaged off the Scottish coast. These
submarines were scuttled after the end of the war during
Operation Deadlight, the disposal of the captured U-boat
fleet. Because they were scuttled, there is no issue of
them being war graves, as vessels sunk in combat would be.
The reasons behind the salavge have been questioned, as
raising a batch of U-boats doesn't seem to be a
particularly economical way of getting scrap metal. In
reality, the ship are not being salvaged to be cut up and
melted down as ordinary scrap. These U-boats represent one
of the last readily available sources of non-radioactive
steel, and are being salvaged for that 'clean' steel.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All steel made since the detonation of the first
atom bomb in 1945 has contained tiny amounts of
radioactivity. This is because the atmosphere now contains
trace amounts of radioactivity. The steelmaking process
involves the use of large amounts of air, which transfers
the radioactivity to the steel.  (((So you're not merely
chewing it with your dentures.  You are breathing it.)))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Instruments and equipment used for measuring
radioactivity must be free from extra background
radiation, so post-1945 'new' steel cannot be used for
these purposes. Instead, pre-1945 'clean' steel is used.
The steel is obtained from the scrapping of pre-1945
ships, and a considerable amount has been obtained from
the German ships scuttled in Scapa Flow at the end of WWI.
(((It's nice clean <STRONG>Nazi</STRONG> steel!)))
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Obviously, steel obtained from these relatively
limited sources is much more valuable than normal steel.
The existing sources for 'clean' steel have mostly dried
up, so the salvage of the U-Boats is economically
justifiable now. The submarines will not be melted down
after salvage, rather, plates cut from the hulls will be
used in their current form.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, since the announcement of the salvage
rights in 1995, everything has grown quiet, and there may
be no actual salvage activity, now or in the future."
(((Oh, I rather imagine the market will perk up when
certain aging consumers at the top of the financial food
chain get it about those dentures.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((The trash problem has always been the devil of the
nuke industry.  Nobody likes radwaste, nobody wants it,
and the mere whisper of "nuclear" metric tonnage arriving
in one's vicinity guarantees a NIMBY frenzy across the
board.  The atmosphere is the place that nobody owns and
where nobody looks.  Historically, for the energy
business, the air is the best place for garbage.  Now
watch the carbon industry engaged with the same logic.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Norwegian turns greenhouse gas to fish fodder
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OSLO == A Norwegian scientist may have found a way to
turn climate gases thought to cause global warming into
fish fodder, a daily newspaper said yesterday.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dagens Naeringsliv reported that professor Olav
Kvalheim at the University of Bergen had come across a
method to utilise emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2)
and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to grow algae which could be fed
to farm fish.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Actually, it's a rather simple technology,'
Kvalheim said, adding that the method could almost
completely remove emissions from gas-fired power plants
into the atmosphere.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new technology, owned by Green Global Energy,
has been tested successfully for NOx and is currently
being tested on CO2.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natural gas development consortiums Naturkraft and
Industrikraft Midt-Norge, which plan to build gas-fired
power plants in western and central Norway both said they
were positive about the new technology.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The Global Green Systems technology is
interesting because it offers a very good resource
exploitation,' said Petter Haugen of Industrikraft Midt-
Norge."
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((What's happening here?  Industrial carbon
recycling.  Algae eat natural gas waste.  Fish eat algae,
and somewhere along the line, people eat those fish.
Carbon isn't radwaste and doesn't go into tin cans, but
the point is: these are extractive energy industries, and
there isn't any place to "throw it away."  We live in a
biosphere, and sooner or later, garbage ends up inside of
us. There's an interesting question here.  How much of the
biosphere, and of contemporary human beings, is actually,
physically composed of industrial effluent?
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((For the last 10,000 years,  CO2 was stable at
about 280 parts per million.  Over the last century it
began a steep rise, and is now at  360 ppm.   Unless I
miss my guesstimate, this should mean that when you eat a
pear  (say, an organic, non-GMO, pesticide-free, non-
radioactive pear, straight from the health-food store),
more than a fifth of the carbon in that fruit is
smokestack emissions.   Then there are other, non-carbon
emissions which are also biologically active: the methane,
the sulfur in coal and oil....
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((How much of you came from a smokestack?  Let's
mull it over, Viridian-style!  There's the age of the
subject, and how long he or she has been exposed to our
mounting CO2 rates... Even a newborn human infant must be
substantially composed of recycled fossil fuel....  There
might be preferential uptake rates among fossil carbon
isotopes....  Okay, it takes better physics and physiology
than I can supply to answer this question.  But: how much
of our flesh is trash?  Who knows this, and who can find
it out?)))</P>
