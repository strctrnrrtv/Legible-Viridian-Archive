modish subject of anthrax, but too weird not to send to

<P>(((It's my bet that these APEC  characters brought in this
Aussie venture capital guy because he promised to "think
outside the box" and do some "real paradigm-busting."
Where'd they dig him up, though?  I don't know.  If you're
really interested, maybe you should call him and report
back to us.)))</P>

"CHINA: October 22, 2001
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"SHANGHAI == Genetically modified fruit and other
food could be used in future to deliver medicine,
including a vaccine against anthrax, an Australian bio-
technology fund manager said on the weekend.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The distinction between food and drugs will
gradually disappear,' said Peter Carre, chairman of
Xcelerator Life Sciences Funds Group.  (((Yahoo!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Medicine will be in milk, it'll be in stuff we
ingest every day. Food will be the most widely used form
to distribute medicine,' Carre said at a business
conference on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) summit.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carre said bananas were already being genetically
modified in research laboratories for all types of
medicinal purposes, including immunisation against four
strains of anthrax.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Why bananas? They grow quickly, people like them
and they took early. You could have done it in a tomato if
you wanted,' Carre told reporters after a speech to the
conference.  (((Also, they provide more comic relief even
than cucumbers.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carre said Cornell University in upstate New York
was leading development work on genetically modifying food
to deliver medicines to people." (...)</P>
