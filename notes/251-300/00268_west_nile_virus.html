<P>"SCIENCE SCOPE"</P>

<P>North and South.   The West Nile virus continues to march
across the North American continent at breathtaking pace.
This summer it has appeared in many places in the southern
U.S. and in southern Canada, and local health authorities
everywhere are stepping up surveillance and control
efforts.  the virus has claimed its first victim this
year, a 71-year-old woman from downtown Atlanta who died
on 11 August.  Three other elderly people == two in
Florida, one in New York City == have fallen ill so far.
<BR></P>

<P>"West Nile is a mosquito-borne virus that primarily
infects birds but can be spread to humans and other
mammals.  Its first outbreak hit New York City in the
summer 2 years ago. Last year it spread to most states in
New England and as far south as North Carolina.  Now, the
agent has also been found in dead birds in Georgia,
Florida and Louisiana.  'It's made a big jump,' said
virologist Robert Tesh of the University of Texas Medical
Branch in Galveston.  (((Note: this Texas medical center
is not the Texas medical center drowned in the Great
Houston Flood of 2001.  Though since it's in Galveston, it
must be quite vulnerable to hurricanes.  Today, San
Antonio is experiencing flash floods.  In Austin, it is
raining steadily.)))
</P>

  <P>"Canadian scientists who detected the virus in two
dead birds from southern Ontario were still awaiting
confirmation from an independent lab at press time.
Although mosquito activity dwindles in the northern US and
Canada by fall (((in normal weather, that is))) southern
states may also see the disease through the winter, Tesh
says.  And at the rate the virus is advancing, 'I wouldn't
be surprised to see it in Houston by the end of the
summer.'"  (((Examine Viridian Note 00251: Houston
Mosquitoes, on the vast host of mosquitoes that followed
the Houston Great Flood.  Soon they'll be armed!)))</P>

<P>(((There are those who wonder why an obscure virus from
politically disturbed Egypt suddenly showed up in a major
US population center.  It's taken two years to spread, but
boy is it spreading.  Then consider this evil little squib
in the same magazine, two pages later.))</P>

<P>"Going Nowhere.  Negotiations over measures to ensure
compliance with the 30-year-old Biological and Toxin
Weapons Convention have come to an ignominious end. Last
month the U.S. delegation at the talks announced its
staunch opposition to the measures, set out in a draft
treaty protocol ((((In Kyoto, they're unsurprised))).</P>

<P>"So the representatives from 55 nations instead tried to
craft a consensus statement to preserve the current draft
protocol as a basis for future discussions.  (((Next
summer, let's say, when there's a sudden spike in the
encephalitis stats.))).</P>

<P>"But even that document landed in the wastebasket in the
final minutes of a monthlong negotiating session that
ended 18 August.  The U.S. delegation objected to language
that hinted at its opposition to the protocol.  (((Imagine
the lese majeste of telling people that the USA blocks
treaties.))) The disagreement doesn't bode well for a
November review conference at which treaty states are
meant to take stock of potential bioweapons threats that
have emerged during the past 5 years.  (((How about those
mosquitoes that emerged in Texas in the past five days?  I
killed two in my bathroom this morning.  Now my head's all
ache-y... &lt;swoon&gt;)))</P>

  <P>"Bioweapons expert Graham Pearson of the United 
  Kingdom's University of Bradford predicts 'a lot of
recrimination' at that meeting.  Others share the
pessimism.  'I hate to think that you can't get countries
to act unless a disaster strikes,' says Barbara Hatch
Rosenberg, chair of the Federation of American Scientists'
biological weapons working group."  (((Oh come on,
Barbara.  Would you recognize a biological disaster when
it struck you?  The Global Climate Coalition could always
form a bio-offshoot and deny that the plagues were
manmade.  What are you supposed to do for us then?  And if
you <STRONG>know</STRONG> what to do, why didn't you do it for Kyoto?)))</P>
