<p><strong>Key concepts:</strong> politics, Kyoto, Bush administration,
  International Day of Action Against  ExxonMobil,
  July 11, 02001, Jeffords, US Senate, Zac Goldsmith, Chris
  Doran, Carwil James, Ross Gelbspan, Steve Kretzmann, Alex
  Tapia</p>

<P><strong>Attention Conservation Notice:</strong>  Long update about
climate politics with nothing about green postindustrial
design.  Normally we Viridians don't cover political news,
especially Yankee domestic politics (ick!), but there's a
whole lot going on today, and none of it looks good for
the forces of evil. Over 3,000 words.</P>

<P>(((In Viridian Note 00255: ExxonMobil Global Day of Rage,
we asked:)))</P>

<P>"I would wager that July 11, 02001 will pass without the
world's largest corporate multinational crumbling, or even
much noticing.  But that's not the interesting part.
What gets me is that some little NGO infowar guy is
sitting there picking out dates like 'July 11.'  And then
the word more or less actually gets out.  What on earth is
that about?  Who is this guy? Where does he get that
authority?"</P>

<P>(((That was no idle question, and swift as email
lightning, lo the answer came.)))</P>

Rage<BR></P>

<!-- end of auto-detected mail header as "NORMAL" -->
<P>"I can tell you a little more about the guy who picked
July 11.  His name is Chris Doran.  Like myself, Chris is
a Green Party activist here in Seattle.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few months ago, he came to me and said he was
starting a new direct action group aimed at calling out
corporate power and wanted to first target the fossil fuel
business. That was to become PressurePoint.  I became a
member of the Advisory Board.  Chris' discussions with me
and others led to the ExxonMobil boycott.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to underscore that Green Parties around the
world are playing a core role in this.  Alex de Roo, a
Green MP in the EuroParliament, was already calling for a
global boycott of U.S. oil companies.  Chris went to the
Global Greens Gathering in Canberra in April (the first of
its kind) and helped push through approval of the Euro
call, with a direct action focus on ExxonMobil.  More than
100 events are planned worldwide for tomorrow, and Greens
will be involved in many of these.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"E-organizing, as you allude to in your message,
allows a small group such as PressurePoint to put out the
word and make things happen.  It also has allowed the
organization of the Global Greens, which had its
inspiration in the first Global Greens statements on any
issue == the climate statements to the Kyoto and Buenos
Aires summits (of which I along with de Roo was lead
author).  Those statements were only possible because of
e-mail connections among Greens on six continents.
Electronic communication is driving and empowering
grassroots politics."</P>

<P>(((Great stuff, huh?  And all <STRONG>I</STRONG> have to do is
re-format it and hit the RETURN key!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, in all of this we were much helped by
Bush, whose blatant cancellation of Kyoto stirred things
up in a way a Gore administration would not have.  There
we would have seen continued insider baseball between
environmental activists and the administration over arcana
like carbon sequestration and emissions trading.  Through
these Clinton was duplicitously gutting the treaty, and I
expect Gore would have continued. Bush made the issue, I
think. So does Zac Goldsmith of The Ecologist, as reported
below."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Later this year I will present the first of The
Ecologist magazine's 'Environmental Steward of the Year'
awards. And it is President George Bush that we must
salute as our unlikely hero.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bush is to the environmental movement what petrol is
to the car. He is the catalyst people like me have been
waiting for.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the facts. American environmental groups
report a large increase in donations since his
inauguration; the global environmental crisis is making
headlines like never before; and politicians of every hue
are clamouring, albeit unconvincingly, to present their
Green credentials.  (((The idea that green donations can
outspend Exxon-Mobil seems a tad far-fetched;
"credentials" or no, in an open political market, the
fossil fuel industry can buy all the politicians it
wants.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even more significantly, there is a growing
acceptance that the protesters who routinely take to the
streets wherever Bush appears, and wherever world leaders
gather to discuss the global economy, may actually have a
point."  (((Though every guy in that crowd of summit-
hoppers has got his <STRONG>own</STRONG> point; and some of 'em have ten
or twelve!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two weeks ago I appeared as a guest on BBC's Question
Time. Before the cameras rolled there was a warm-up debate
about Gothenburg. (There, if you remember, some 25,000
people took to the streets to protest against lack of
action on climate change in the US.) What astonished me in
the following debate was that nearly everyone == both in
the audience and on the panel == viewed the protest as
healthy and necessary."  (((Oh come on == it's dead easy
to complain about the USA <STRONG>in Gothenburg.</STRONG>  That's  a
lead-pipe cinch, like buying a Love Parade CD in Freiberg,
"Solar Capital of Germany.")))

<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This would not  have been the case even two years
ago. All this is down to Bush. While he is hated by many
in the environmental movement, he is in fact our saviour.
He has put lead in the Green pencil."  (((Hey man, I
thought lead was bad for kids.)))</P>

<P>"On Wednesday (July 11), an array of groups will be
protesting the policies of ExxonMobil. Many are calling
for a boycott of the oil giant. The following activists
and policy analysts are available for interviews:</P>

Doran is campaigns director for PressurePoint, an
organization launching its first major campaign directed
at ExxonMobil on Wednesday. Doran said today:</P>

<P>"'ExxonMobil might be the richest corporation in the
world, but morally it is bankrupt. The U.S. government's
climate change policy is the ExxonMobil policy. What sort
of democracy do we have when one company can buy off our
political process for its own gains? We're turning up the
heat on ExxonMobil and George W. Bush to take real action
on climate change and corporate influence."  (((Nice
pullquote, Chris!  Way to sling those soundbites!  He's a
rookie, but he's got a golden future....)))</P>

Oil Campaign coordinator for Project Underground, James
said today:</P>

<P>"'ExxonMobil often leads the charge in the oil industry's
effort to lower environmental protections and to open new
ecosystems and homelands to oil drilling, and leads in
breaking even those lowered environmental standards. In
1997, CEO Lee Raymond blatantly warned developing
countries to lower environmental standards or risk losing
foreign investment. From the half-million people affected
by a 1998 Mobil oil spill in Nigeria to the billion
dollars Mobil gave Russian and Kazakh partners for
transactions with no apparent business purpose in 1999,
the company consistently fails to be accountable to the
communities its destructive operations affect."   (((Drop

is happening to the climate."  (((<STRONG>How</STRONG> far beyond is

rights violations, ExxonMobil is at the top of the list of
offenders. There has just been a suit filed against it for
collaboration in ongoing human rights violations,
including murders, in Indonesia. It is cooperating with
the repressive regime in Chad. ExxonMobil should suspend
operations in these areas immediately."  (((And while

<P>"Jeffords named Senate environment panel chairman</P>

<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>USA: July 11, 2001<BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"WASHINGTON == Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont, who gave
Democrats control of the Senate last month when he
defected from the Republicans, became chairman of the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee yesterday,
vowing to challenge President George W. Bush's record on
environmental protection.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jeffords, now an independent, was unanimously approved
by Democrats as the first head of a standing Senate
committee in 68 years who is not a member of a major
political party.  (((He may not get a lot done in that
post, but boy oh boy, what a plum role from which to
torment the Administration.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jeffords promised to challenge Bush on a number of
recent environmental rollbacks, ranging from rejecting a
proposed treaty to combat global warming (((ooh la la)))
to breaking a campaign vow to try to impose mandatory
emissions reductions for carbon dioxide at electrical
power plants.  ((("Read My Lips 2.0")))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jeffords, a longtime advocate for tougher clean-air
standards,  (((oh my oh my)))  has also opposed a key
component of Bush's energy plan == drilling for oil and
natural gas in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
(((It's deader than Minitel!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I've been disappointed by his environmental record,'
Jeffords told reporters. 'I hope he will begin to see
things differently.'  ((("Wrote me off, did you Mr
President?  Dissed me to my face!  Well, we'll see about
that.")))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The senator arranged to meet yesterday with
Christine Todd Whitman, head of the Environmental
Protection Agency.  (((Life must be rich and full for
Christie these days.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jeffords, who has often been at odds with Bush, had
been widely expected to get the chairmanship of the
environment panel since he left the Republican Party on
June 5, handing Democrats a one-seat margin in the
chamber.   (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senate Majority Whip Harry Reid of Nevada, as the
environment committee's ranking Democrat, had been in line
to get the chairmanship.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Democratic aides said Reid told Jeffords during
private talks that helped lead to the Vermont lawmaker's
decision to leave the Republicans that he would step aside
and allow Jeffords to become chair as an independent."
((("Here is your chair, sir, and here is your whip and
your pistol.")))</P>

<P>(((Killing Kyoto was one of the first things the Bush
Administration did.  This was supposed to be a decisive,
take-charge, businesslike thing to do.  After all, Kyoto
had been hanging on like a zombie in the US Senate for
years, unvoted-on, and even the treaty's best friends
didn't like it.  But, like a lot of left-wing
intellectuals, Kyoto is much more effective as a martyr
than it ever was as an administrator.)))</P>

<P>"Jeffords to Tackle Global Warming</P>

<P>By JOHN HEILPRIN</P>

<P>Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vermont Sen. James Jeffords named global warming as
his first priority when he formally became chairman of the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Tuesday.
((("First priority" implies that Jeffords will get around
to a second priority, but no; this is going to go on for
four years.)))
<BR></P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The newly independent lawmaker whose defection from
the Republican Party tipped the Senate to Democratic
control last month promised hearings by early August on
his proposed Clean Energy Act.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Being a rock star isn't easy,' he joked of all the
attention he's been receiving.   'It won't last long.'
(((Because revenge is a dish best eaten cold.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jeffords' bill is an effort to force coal-fired
electrical power plants to clean up or shut down by
mandating strict carbon dioxide emission standards and
creating incentives for the use of clean, alternative
power. (((Couldn't ask for better.  Not that we'll get it,
but....)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'There's a real perception among all the people of
this world that we need to do something about the
pollution or else this world is going to change rapidly,'
he said.  'The urgency is pretty evident now.'  (((You
gotta be a genuine heretic to utter the truth in Yankee
politics these days.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jeffords said he also hopes to nudge the Bush
administration back toward the negotiating table on a 1997
climate treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan  == something
British Ambassador Christopher Meyer also urged the
senator to do at a meeting Tuesday.   (((Why, the turncoat
even dares to meet with Europeans!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I assured him I was going to do my best to make
sure we were able to work with the European Community in
handling these problems,' said Jeffords.  (...)

<P>"Senator McCain urges Bush to act now on climate change
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WASHINGTON  == Saying delay is unacceptable, two
leading U.S. senators yesterday called for the Bush
administration to help Congress write legislation to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions blamed by most scientists
for speeding global warming.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Republican John McCain of Arizona and Massachusetts
Democrat John Kerry said at a Senate Commerce panel
hearing they would introduce a bill within the next few
days to speed technology investments for cutting
greenhouse gases.  (((Whoopee!  Great news for the
piezoelectric-eel contingent.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new political pressure on the Bush
administration came one week before international
negotiators gather in Bonn for a major climate change
conference.  (...)   McCain made an unsuccessful bid for
the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, while Kerry
has been mentioned as a potential Democratic presidential
candidate in 2004.  (((Uh, yeah.  Exactly.  Plenty of time
to go for each other's throats in 2004; the game now is to
make Bush look awful.)))</P>

<P>"KERRY SAYS BUSH MISLED PUBLIC
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry blasted President George W. Bush's stance on
global warming. He mocked the administration for saying it
was still studying the issue at the same time Bush has
already blocked international and domestic initiatives
aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  (((True
enough.  They're not merely dismissing Kyoto, they're
busily running around hitting conservation, research,
foreign aid and green-power initiatives.  This makes it
clear that the Bush Administration's climate policy is not
merely ideological or regionalist objections to Kyoto.
The Bush Administration is the political wing of Exxon-
Mobil's competitive strategy.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We're in fact being misled. The president is not
just studying the issue,' Kerry said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Democratic senator criticized Bush's track
record on the climate change question, including  his
declaration that Kyoto was dead and for releasing a
national energy plan which would increase emissions by 35
percent in the coming years.  (((This "35 percent" thing
probably has a loose attachment to fact, but it will be
the new soundbite henceforth.)))</P>

<P>"MCCAIN SAYS ACTION NEEDED</P>

<P>"McCain said even though skeptics can be found within the
scientific community on what causes global warming == be
it man-made causes or natural warming == the fact is the
globe is warming, thereby providing an opportunity to use
alternative fuel sources and methods.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I guess the question is, how long do you wait for
this body of science to become unanimous,' McCain said.
(((Oh, it's already unanimous; the only "scientists"
objecting are underwritten by the GCC, which is
ExxonMobil's pseudoscience wing.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said even 'modest action' needs to be explored,
even as broader steps are pondered by Bush and the
Congress.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I feel it is important we fully explore all policy
options, including mandatory emission reductions, before
proceeding with any final and definitive position,' McCain
said.  ((("I plan to run every smidgen of this issue
through the wringer as long as Bush suffers political
damage from it.")))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kerry said the technology exists now to begin
shifting American transportation and industry away from
dirtier-burning fuels, giving Congress the opening to
approve measures to fund more research into zero emission
fuel cells, as an example.   (((Atari Democrat 1980s
redux.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I believe that the burden is on us to create the
push and pull of incentives and mandates that will move
these technologies into the marketplace for the benefit of
our economy and our environment,' Kerry said.  (((Golden
words for <A HREF="http://www.awea.org/">www.awea.org</A>.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Massachusetts Democrat also blasted the
administration for refusing to send anyone to the
hearing."  ((("We're Senators.  We'll sit here for years
on end.  The barbs are sinking in and you're starting to
bleed, pal.  Next time, send some flak-catchers who look
good on TV.  Christie will do.")))</P>
