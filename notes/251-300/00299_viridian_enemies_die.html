<H2>Viridian Note 00299: Viridian Enemies Die</H2>
<EM>Bruce Sterling [<A HREF="mailto:bruces@well.com">bruces@well.com</A>]</EM><BR>

  <p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Global Climate Coalition, Greening
  Earth Society, spin-doctors, anti-Kyoto lobbyists,
  Viridian class enemies, organizational death</p>
  

<P><strong>Attention Conservation Notice:</strong>  About the demise
of evil organizations that Viridians can't stand.</P>

This cheery rant I wrote for the local counterculture
rag says nice things about weblogs and webloggers,
so it is getting blogged all over the place.

<P>Bob Morris, the noble soul running our Viridian contest
site, has himself started a blog.

<P>Remember what I was saying earlier about DNA-based
computers?  Well, this guy makes them.  Yet
another Viridian example of "predicting the present."

<P>Just a few of the many awful things we have said in the
past about the unspeakable Global Climate Coalition.

<P>"The Global Climate Coalition has been deactivated. 
The industry voice on climate change has served its
purpose by contributing to a new national approach to
global warming. 
<BR></P>

<P>"The Bush administration will soon announce a climate
policy that is expected to rely on the development of new
technologies to reduce greenhouse emissions, a concept
strongly supported by the GCC.
<BR></P>

<P>"The coalition also opposed Senate ratification of
the Kyoto Protocol that would assign such stringent
targets for lowering greenhouse gas emissions that
economic growth in the U. S. would be severely hampered
and energy prices for consumers would skyrocket. The GCC
also opposed the treaty because it does not require the
largest developing countries to make cuts in their
emissions.
<BR></P>

<P>"At this point, both Congress and the Administration
agree that the U.S. should not accept the mandatory cuts
in emissions required by the protocol."</P>

<P>(((So, they're finally declaring victory and shutting down
the ol' front group.   The game plan is clear: assume
Kyoto's death, notch up some Alaskan exploration rights
and a better return-on-investment in the Bush energy plan,
then duck for cover while the Enron scandal lasts.</P>

<P>(((The Global Climate Coalition was never "global" or
about "climate"  == it was a domestic inside-the-Beltway
lobby group whose goal was to logjam US Senate
confirmation of the Kyoto treaty.  With that much
accomplished, it is time for them to split, or in their
own terms, "deactivate." There's always work elsewhere for
the spinmeisters.)))</P>

<P>"Former GCC Head Hired To Do Energy PR</P>

<P>"Glenn Kelly, former executive director of the now-defunct
Global  Climate Coalition, has been hired by Qorvis
Communications as managing  director of the firm's energy,
natural resources and environmental PA  practice. GCC had
been the most outspoken and confrontational  industry
group in the United States battling reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions and the Kyoto Protocol. 'The
group said in a statement  that it has served its purpose
and supports the Bush Administration's  voluntary measures
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,' O'Dwyer's
writes. Source: O'Dwyer's PR Daily, February 27, 2002."</P>

<P>(((We Viridians have predicted the formal demise of the
GCC for some time.  That it should happen so quietly and
with so little fanfare, after so much harm done to the
prospects of humanity,  is a source of wonder.  Much to my
further wonderment, however, the much smaller and even
crazier Greening Earth Society, an outfit we especially
abhorred, is also cratering.)))</P>

<P>"OUR SITE HAS A NEW NAME AND NEW CONTENT</P>


<P>"Welcome to CO2andClimate.org, Greening Earth Society's
newly expanded resource center for information concerning
the impact of rising atmospheric CO2 levels on earth's
climate and the biosphere.</P>

<P>"What's the Same?  We're still the best place on the Web
to find news, research and articles that express
scientific skepticism over the potential for catastrophic
changes in climate due to CO2 emissions.</P>

<P>"What's New?  Our newly expanded content explores how
exciting developments in the science of carbon
sequestration can benefit agriculture, the environment and
mankind."</P>

<P>(((What's <STRONG>not</STRONG> the same at the newly-renamed GES  is this
surprising new emphasis on "catastrophic change."
Greening Earth, which is bankrolled by coal companies,
always denied there would be <STRONG>any</STRONG> climate change == and
that if there were, it would surely be a blessing: bumper
crops, delightful winter weather and all that.
<BR></P>

<P>(((Their emphasis on sequestration is entirely new, and
very Bush II.  So is the sudden departure of chief
Greening Earth zealot and propagandist, Chris Paynter.)))</P>

<P>"I just wanted to let everyone know that subscribes to
the Greening Earth Society (CO2 and Climate Alerts) that
today is my last day with Greening Earth Society.
<BR></P>

<P>"I have thoroughly enjoyed my past 4 years at GES and
want to wish all of you the best of luck in the future.
If anyone needs to contact me in the future I can be
reached by email at <A HREF="mailto:cpaynter@yahoo.com">cpaynter@yahoo.com</A>.

<P>(((Chris doesn't say why he left (or was kicked overboard)
but I swear I'll miss the guy.  Chris Paynter was the
infallible lodestone of Greenhouse incorrectness, like a
needle that always pointed south.  Why a guy of his
fanatical devotion to mischief  should have to suffer such
an indignity after four years of selfless labor, that I'll
never know.  I can only assume he's headed some place more
lucrative.  If you can find out where Chris is lurking
henceforth, by all means let the rest of us know.  One
thing is certain: it can't be good.</P>

<P>(((I can speculate on the meaning of these events.  The
keys are (a) the Enron scandal and (b) the Cheney Energy
policy and its so-very-secret authors.   When Bush II
tried to abolish Kyoto (one of their first actions in
office) the GCC cabal was living high on the Washington
hog. They are now massive political liabilities.  However,
they achieved at least one major and lasting victory.  So
the word has gone out to take the profits and lie low.)))
<BR></P>

<P>(((What does this mean to Viridians?  Well, we always
defined ourselves as an org in stern opposition to these
two groups.  So it is now incumbent on us to reform <STRONG>our
own</STRONG> activities.  The 300th Viridian Note will shortly be
upon us.  After that major milestone, prepare yourself for
some novel Viridian organizational developments.)))
<BR></P>

<P>(((In the meantime, we will have to pick out some new
object of unifying hatred from these many surviving
Greenhouse pressure groups.  Or else, we can discover the
newest versions of the GCC and GES, in whatever evil
guises their founders choose to reassert themselves.)))</P>
