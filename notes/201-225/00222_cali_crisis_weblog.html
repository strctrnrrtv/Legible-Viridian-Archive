  <P>Key concepts: California energy crisis, news sources<BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Attention Conservation Notice: Vast, endless,
provocative of utter confusion, an attention hog
of the first order, natters on and on, host of
dizzying links</P>

<P>(((The California Energy Crisis is currently front page
news.  It's certainly not the business of Viridian List
to replicate the work of mass media organs.  On the
contrary, when our issues become mainstream issues, we
will gratefully declare victory and shut up shop.</P>

<P>(((However, this is a particularly dense, wicked
situation. We believe we can cover some aspects of the
crisis that nobody else is telling you about.</P>

<P>(((Our primary Viridian interest is, as usual, the
Greenhouse Effect.</P>

<P>(((There's some very good news here.  Natural gas
is expensive this year because North America is having
a cold winter.  It's very pleasant to know that we can
still have some cold winters.</P>

<P>(((The California crisis has two other weather-related
aspects, not so pleasant.  First, there's a drought in the
Pacific Northwest.  The Northwest usually sells a lot of
cheap hydropower to California during winter.   This year
the water-power is not around, and it's lack is sorely
felt.</P>

<P>(((The second aspect is lingering aftereffects from
California's shocking 109-degree summer of 2000.
California's power plants and grid are old and rundown.
These weather extremes seem to be hastening their
disrepair. Southern Energy spokesman Chuck Griffin has
been quoted thusly:  "This whole idea of us somehow
withholding capacity is completely bogus.  We run them
until they break."  And last summer they broke. California
is missing 10,000 megawatts of capacity, due to repairs.
If California is going to melt-down every other summer or
so, then no infrastructure is really fixable.)))</P>

<P>(((On other bright-side again, many enviros feel that it's
just plain good for people to have an energy crisis. For
instance, John Schaeffer at realgoods.com is ecstatic.)))</P>

<BR></P>

<P>"I'm bursting at the seems with the urge to say 'we told
you so!' but I'm resisting.  (((John is not resisting real
hard.))))  (...) As we've seen over our company history,
Americans are a short sighted people, and don't tend to
take anything seriously until a crisis is upon them.
(((Lash those sinners without pity!)))</P>

<P>"So, conservation is back in the news, solar energy is a
hot topic, energy independence and being off-the-grid are
again coveted, and the phones at Real Goods Renewables are
ringing off the hook. Just like they did when Three Mile
Island blew, when Chernobyl collapsed, when the Exxon
Valdez dumped, when the gas lines grew, and when the Scuds
flew to Baghdad...."</P>

<P>(((Boy, life is great, isn't it?  But wait....  The crisis
has been grim for California's little green utilities. Go-
Green, an infant green choice power company, has been
killed.)))</P>

<P>"Green power in the red
"Electricity deregulation is bankrupting California's
fledgling eco-friendly energy industry.</P>

<P>"In April, Ray Levinson persuaded the U.S. Postal Service
to make the largest federal purchase of eco-friendly power
in U.S. history.  (...)
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"But just a few months after the contract was signed,</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>electricity prices in California started to jump == an
unforeseen result of the state's flawed electricity
deregulation scheme. Levinson hoped that the contract
would remain secure. Go-Green's power wasn't subject,
theoretically, to the ups and downs of the fossil-fuel
business, so shouldn't the cost of steam remain stable? He
figured Go-Green would be less likely to go bankrupt than
a traditional utility like Pacific Gas &amp; Electric."
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(((But Go-Green was <STRONG>not</STRONG> a green power 
  <STRONG>generator.</STRONG></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>They were just a packager/retailer.  Go-Green couldn't
"stabilize" a thing, because they didn't own the means of
production.  It was big, scary, right-wing capitalist guys
like Enron who were actually <STRONG>making</STRONG> the green power.
And Enron is making money like crazy == or at least,
they're owed a lot.)))
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"He figured wrong. In September, Go-Green founder Rick</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Kohl told Levinson that he was having trouble getting
enough credit to buy green power from power wholesalers.
The wholesalers (Calpine, Enron and others) had jacked up
their prices from 6 cents per kilowatt-hour to about
$1.50."</P>

<P>(((Note that this is <STRONG>green power</STRONG> that's going at $1.50
per hour.  A green power gold mine.)))</P>

<P>(...) "In December, Go-Green went out of business,
abandoning not just the post offices but also MCI WorldCom
and 2,500 residential customers who had also decided to go
green.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Go-Green is but one of many clean-energy companies</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>that have recently ceased operations. TenderLand Power Co.
of Truckee, Calif., also booted customers back to the big
utilities this month. Several other green power companies
in California and in Pennsylvania == another state that's
deep in the throes of deregulation == have also fled the
business."
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>(((Actually, Pennsylvania has very little in the way</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>of "throes of deregulation."  There is no "Pennsylvania
energy crisis".  Pennsylvania has the best-marketed green
utilities in the US; people are actually buying the stuff
on purpose there.  There's also a distinct lack of
"throes" in de-regulated Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut,
Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas,
Virginia and West Virginia.  It's only California that's
big on "throes" this season.)))
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"The consequences for the environment, say some</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>industry watchdogs, will be horrific."   (((Sorta.  It's a
mistake to conflate a loss of packagers with a loss of
green voltage.   California is still the number-one state
in the USA when it comes to renewable energy.  With sun,
wind, hydro and geothermal, California's up to an
impressive 12 percent green.  There's a huge market for
it, too, cost no object at the moment.  Nobody is shutting
down California's green hardware.  But everybody who
trusted California's wacky business model is going to the
wall.)))</P>

<P>(((How come Go-Green didn't own the means of green
production, one may ask? Well, they weren't allowed to.
In California's strange legal power-regime, utilities
don't get to be generators.  So California's "out of state
pirate generators" are the out-of-state people who bought
California's own generators when the California utilities
were forced to sell them in 1996.</P>

<P>(((The most plausible outcome of this crisis?  Debt-for-
equity.  The "pirate generators" quietly buy out the
bankrupt shells of the California utilities, in exchange
for the colossal debt they're owned for the overpriced
gas.  Generators walk, packagers talk. Electrons boom,
bits brown-out. It's the Next New Thing.)))</P>

<P>"While Californians suffer through one of the state's
worst energy crises, major power companies are pocketing
billions of dollars in profits as they exploit chronic
shortages and soaring electricity rates.</P>

<P>"This week, California utilities were paying more than
$1,000 per megawatt for power that sold for just $45 at
this time a year ago. (((Whoopee!))) (...)</P>

<P>"The leading power generators for California include
Reliant Energy, El Paso Energy Corp., Dynegy and Enron
Corp., all of Houston; as well as Duke Energy Corp. of
Charlotte, N.C.; AES Corp. of Arlington, Va.; Southern Co.
of Atlanta;  and Calpine Corp. of San Jose. (((Gutsy
little Calpine being California's own native "pirate
generator.")))</P>

<P>"Most of the plants within the state now run by these
firms were previously owned by Pacific Gas and Electric
Co. and Southern California Edison, which were forced to
sell off their generation facilities as part of the 1996
deregulation of California's electricity market.</P>

<P>"'We used to operate many of these plants, so we know how
much it costs to run them,' said Ron Low, a spokesman for
PG&amp;E. 'The prices these guys are charging are completely
unjustified.'</P>

<P>(((And how exactly do massive interlopers like Enron
expect to get away with all that?  Well, for one thing,
while California's dotcoms are in the NASDAQ tank, Enron
is the current darling of Wall Street.  The utility sector
is way, way up for 2000, so they've got stock-swap money
for acquisitions.  And then there's this cozy
relationship, as well:)))</P>

<P>"Key Figure in California's Power Crisis Has Bush's Ear</P>

<P>by Phillip Matier, Andrew Ross  
Wednesday, January 17, 2001</P>

<P>"One powerful name to keep an eye on during this energy
crisis is Kenneth Lay, chairman and CEO of Texas-based
Enron Corp., and a close buddy and contributor to
President-elect George W. Bush. (...)</P>

<P>"Enron (...) was the single largest contributor to Bush's
presidential campaign, giving no less than $555,000,
according to published reports.</P>

<P>"Lay even sent top executives a memo on his personal
stationery asking them to contribute $1,000 each to the
Bush campaign, says the New York Times. (...)</P>

<P>"Lay hired two of Bush's father's Cabinet members and
family confidants == James Baker and Robert Mosbacher ==
after they left office.  (((Imagine yourself as some
ponytailed California city council attorney attempting to
<STRONG>sue James Baker.</STRONG>  Oh man!  Don't even start with me
about "counting the volts.")))</P>

<P>"And just last April, Lay played host to George W. and his
dad at the Houston Astros' first home game at the team's
new stadium . . . Enron Field.</P>

<P>"Three weeks later, according to Tongue Magazine, Lay
joined George W. in Washington for a Republican fund-
raiser that brought in a staggering $21.3 million, easily
the biggest one-night haul for any political party in
history. (((Bring in the kazoos.)))</P>

<P>"What's more, the magazine reports, the Bush campaign
borrowed Enron's corporate jets eight times last year to
fly aides around the country, although the cost of the
trips was later reimbursed as required by law. " (...)
(((There's much, much, more == but why even go on.  The
bright spot:  Enron is a very able and innovative energy
company. Given enough state and federal leeway and the
ignominious death of the old regime, Enron might even be
able to re-power California and get the lights back on.)))</P>

Wind Energy to the Rescue!
"California has recently approved more than 400 MW of new
wind capacity (..). While that will push the state's total
wind capacity to 2,000 MW installed (..) its wind energy
potential, conservatively estimated at 5,000 MW. "
(((Great: there's 5000 megawatts of wind in Cali if you
cover every hill with whirring iron.  Too bad that
California needs and uses some 33,000 megawatts in winter,
and a whopping 47,000 megawatts in summer.)))</P>

What Other States Think of California's Attitude:</P>

<P>"Western Governors Tell California to Build Plants</P>

<P>"LCG, Jan. 15, 2001 == The governors of five Western
states have urged California Gov. Gray Davis to increase
efforts to produce more electricity in the Golden State,
saying in a letter Friday that 'California is not an
electrical island.'</P>

<P>"The governors of Arizona, Nevada, Montana, Utah and
Wyoming told Davis that California, to a much larger
extent, 'needs to share the responsibility of building
more generation plants with adequate fuel supply,
electrical transmission facilities and gas pipelines and
deal with the inherent environmental challenges that
presents.'"  ((("Stop consuming the voltage, while we have
to eat the smog.")))</P>
