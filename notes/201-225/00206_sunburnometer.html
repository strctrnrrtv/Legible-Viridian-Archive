<P>The Viridian Disaster Alarm Clock is an elegant, stylish
bedside accessory.  It monitors radio and internet
newsfeeds and weather reports, listening for  travel
information and adverse weather warnings.  Linked to your
personal  diary system, it knows where you should be
travelling to, and by what means. It can check transport
information from relevant websites.</P>

<P>When your alarm goes off at the set time, the Viridian
Disaster Alarm Clock can  tell you in soothing tones to
return to bed. An example:</P>

<P>"Good morning Dave. There are no northbound rail services
this morning owing to fallen trees, the roads to the
airport are flooded, and all flights are cancelled due to
heavy weather. Go back to sleep, you'll not  get to
Germany today."</P>

<P>I could really have used one of these on Monday when the
southern UK fell apart quite spectacularly in an orgy of
Greenhouse weather violence.</P>

<H2>1. Smart luggage for the weary, jet-lagged and/or ill  traveler.</H2>

<P>I am tired of trying to remember what to pack in my
suitcase. I want my suitcase to remember for me and tell
me about it. I'd ask the chip "What did I pack when I went
to Shanghai for two weeks in October?"  It would tell me
the full packing list, including remembering various
ambient temperatures (local time-date stamped), totals of
all the receipts I stuffed into its pockets, whether I
used up all the mosquito repellent last time, and whether
any food I packed into it would flunk inspection at any
customs checkpoints. My luggage would also remind me if I
forgot to pack my toothbrush before I zipped it up and
took it out of the hotel.</P>

<P>The bag would need voice-recognition, a speaker/alarm, an
electric eye to scan stuff (including anyone forcibly
opening the luggage), flash memory, and it should be
immune to international airport x-rays and abusive baggage
handlers. It would also contain a solar- and piezo-charged
power source that would power a transponder with a unique
electronic sig in the likely event that this luggage ever
got lost or loaded on the wrong plane.</P>

<P>The Aspidistra</P>

<P>When writing software, the best way to find a logical flaw
is  to sit down and explain what the code is supposed to
be doing, line by  line. Usually, the very act  of
explaining it is enough for you to realise what you have
done  wrong, so the listener doesn't need to comment much.
My colleagues  used to refer to this as 'being an
Aspidistra'.</P>

<P>The Neologue Aspidistra is a potted plant fitted with a
speech recognition  chip. When it hears the word
'Aspidistra' it settles down to listen  to you explain
code. It makes appropriate 'uh huh' and 'I see'  sounds.
If it's more advanced, it might ask a few cogent questions
such as 'where do you  dispose of that?', then go
quiescent  again when it hears your response 'oh, I see
now, never mind.'</P>

<P>#1 Babyminder Blobby</P>

<P>Problem:</P>

<P>It's nine in the evening. You're sitting downstairs
enjoying a beer  with your partner and a couple of
friends. You  have one of those little intercom things
linked up to little junior's  bedroom. The evening's
going well, some raucous adult laughter as you reminisce.
But every now and again someone goes  'Hush == did I just
hear a noise on the intercom?' Everyone goes quiet, turns
down the stereo; waits. False alarm.</P>

<P>But then you can't remember where you left off the
discussion, the  pace of your friend's funny story is
disrupted, and you just missed the great twangy guitar
bit. You don't even dare turn up your music again, as you
feel the need to monitor the intercom more closely  for a
while.</P>


<P>Solution:</P>


<P>Babyminder Blobby is tuned to recognise the various noises
specifically made by your infant.  It can distinguish
between murmur, yell and call for  mummy/mommy/maman etc.
(Localisation for different cultures will be important.)</P>


<P>It responds appropriately:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>murmur: increases its own sensitivity ('gain') for five
  minutes,  going on alert for follow-up noises, but not
  doing anything</LI>

  <LI>minor disturbance: pulses a gentle light, softly
  recites a nursery rhyme</LI>

  <LI>major disturbance (defined as repeated yelling or five
  calls for mummy in less than a minute): increases volume
  on nursery rhyme, sends alert to remote Blobby downstairs
  to alert parent or babysitter.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Blobby also keeps statistics for 'management reports',
e.g. "In the last week, Junior did an average (per night)
of 5 murmurs, 2 yells and 1.5 repeated calls for mum. The
worst night was Thursday with 4 cases through the night
where human intervention was called for. The  best night
was Saturday with just 2 murmurs."</P>


<P>A deluxe babysitter version is available. When Blobby
sends an alert to the babysitter, it also sends a text
message to your mobile phone or PDA. The babysitter may
then alleviate your anxiety by using Blobby to send an
update status report.</P>


<P>Design features:
<BR></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Blobby sets come as readily anthropomorphised pairs of
  toy-like objects, designed to look like your older sister
  and brother. At bedtime, junior is encouraged to 'say</LI>

</UL>
<DL>
  <DT>goodnight to Blobby</DT><DD>she's going to keep you safe through
  the night'. This reinforces the comforting impact of
  Blobby's responses to minor disturbances.
  </DD></DL>
<UL>
  <LI>Blobbies come in every colour from loganberry to
  greenhouse to sleet, but the child's unit has transparent
  plastic casing (since, for infants, looking good with a
  range of iMac peripherals is not yet essential).</LI>

  <LI>Physical robustness is also essential for infant's
  Blobby, because inevitably there are times when junior
  craves to throw 'big sister' across the room.</LI>

</UL>

<P>#2 Walk-to-School Guardian</P>

<P>Problem:</P>

<P>In the UK, in 1971, 80% of 7-8 year olds walked to school.
By the  mid-1990s, this figure had dropped to 9%. Most
commonly cited reasons are fears of abduction and fears of
traffic accidents while crossing roads. Traffic related to
taking children to school is blamed for much early morning
and mid-afternoon congestion.</P>

<P>Solution:</P>

<P>School guardians are portable blobjects used as child
docking stations. When they are active they ask the child
every 2-5 minutes "Everything OK?" or some alternative
that is culturally acceptable in the region. Each child
has a specific voice response  which the guardian expects
to hear within 20 secs. If there is no verbal response,
the guardian asks again,  more persistently == also
flashing and vibrating to attract child's attention. If
the chip hears nothing after a further 20 secs, the
guardian raises an alarm at the home and school docking
stations.</P>


<P>If the child feels under threat by a possible abductor,
they simply throw the guardian away.</P>


<P>Each guardian is programmed with an upper limit journey
time between school and home. Docking stations at either
end will go into an 'amber' or 'red' alert if they don't
receive and dock the portable guardian.</P>


<P>At road crossings, the child simply states "road" and the
guardian recites standard safety instructions. In the UK,
this has become known as the Green Cross Code: look left,
look right, look left again, if all clear, start to cross
and keep looking and listening. Again. cultural
localisation will be important (e.g. driving on different
side of road).</P>


<P>Design features:
<BR></P>

<UL>
  <LI>This use of this technology has potentially serious
  impact on the civil liberties of children and young
  adults. A key design consideration is to make sure that
  the children concerned feel safer and stronger with their
  guardians, not like prisoners subjected to electronic
  surveillance. The child user  should decide how much slack
  to give for trips to local shops en route, or the
  occasional diversion to the playground with friends.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI>Other docking stations can be placed in private and</LI>

</UL>
<DL>
  <DT>public spaces as 'safe ports'</DT><DD>a friend's house, the local
  mall. The home docking station displays current status of
  the guardian.
  <BR>
  </DD></DL>
<UL>
  <LI>Use of guardians may disrupt child's use of portably
  minidisk players, mobile phones etc. Many parents will see
  this as a feature, not a bug.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI>Guardians are themed for tie-in with "responsible"
  characters in the latest movies. They may have
  interchangeable 'skins' (like some mobile phones).
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI>Retail and dining outlets aimed at the 6-12 yr age
  group will have their own special 'docking stations'. If
  you dock your guardian at a particular outlet several
  times within an 'offer period' you qualify for special
  deals.</LI>

<P>The Alexander Calder Tribute Site</P>

<P>A Calder-style mobile sculpture has flexible piezoelectric
elements  built into its joints, and wired to a
Recognition Engine.  The mobile wafts gently around from
the "pressure" of people talking about Calder or mobiles.</P>

<P>The Man Ray Tribute Site</P>

<P>Man Ray's "Object to Be Destroyed" (a ticking metronome
with the eye of Lee Miller attached) has an engine chip
inside. When the names "Man Ray" or "Lee Miller" are said,
the metronome stops dead and utters a surrealistic cry of
despair.</P>

<P>The Marcel Duchamp Tribute Site
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>An inverted men's urinal is hung upside down on  a</P>

<P>gallery wall.  Whenever anyone says the keywords "Marcel,"
"Duchamp," or "conceptual art," the Recognition Engine
chip sends a sudden terrifying spray of yellow soap
bubbles out of the urinal and straight into the audience.</P>

<P>Conversational Fans
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Dozens of colorful ceiling fans, equipped with chips,</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>are attached to a tall ballroom ceiling.  The chips count
audible phonemes in the immediate area below the fan, then
cause their fans to revolve quickly or slowly, in direct
proportion to the density of conversation.  Lively
conversations can therefore be quickly spotted from
anywhere in the room.  As a byproduct, talkative cliques
at the event generate their own cooling breeze.</P>

<P>The Jargon Strobe</P>

<P>A darkened discussion space is lit only by strobe lights.
The strobes are wired to Recognition Engines, which fire
off bursts of enlightenment according to a specialized
glossary: say, hip terms from cybernetic techno-art.
Therefore a lively and knowledgeable lecture will steadily
light the  whole area, whereas a halting or off-topic one
leaves the crowd in spasmodic darkness.</P>

<P>The New World Order Firing Squad</P>

<P>An automated firing squad confronts a large, bounding
balloon in an installation shooting gallery.  The guns
dramatically respond to the keywords "Ready," "Aim," and
"Fire."  On "ready" the guns chamber a round, on "aim"
they unsteadily converge at the target, and at "fire" they
shoot pellets.  But the cybernetic guns cannot be directly
touched, are unbearably quirky, and are frequently
disobedient.  Furthermore, the balloon itself is
surprisingly tough and slippery, bounding around at random
directions and speeds.   The intent of this installation
is to increasingly excite and frustrate an ever-growing
and ever-more-bloodthirsty crowd, demanding the balloon's
annihilation.  The frantic voices are recorded and played
back after the balloon finally meets its end.</P>
