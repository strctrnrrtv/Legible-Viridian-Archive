<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  Another magazine
appearance.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Source:  Wired magazine, January 2001 issue,<BR>
  pages 168-169, 176-183.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The latest issue of Wired, just now out on the
stands, centers on design.  Although I've written
many articles for Wired, this is the first time
I've ever appeared in Wired <STRONG>without writing.</STRONG>
I seem to have graduated to the anomalous status
of a demented celebrity.</P>

<P>First, we have a glossy two-page spread on the Viridian
Energy Meter.  What a beauty.   All kudos to Alan AtKisson
and the noble souls at Sustainability Institute.  Somebody
needs to put this Wattbug gizmo into production pronto.
Failing that, they should at least make an instant global
celebrity out of Inci Mutlu, who is the best-looking
female Turkish industrial designer who is not Ayse Birsel.</P>

<P>Second, we have a WIRED round-table discussion on design
chaired by the fabulous and ultra-informed  Chee Pearlman.
This event took place in the San Francisco offices of
IDEO.  Everybody in that office has a Tolomeo lamp
designed by Michele de Lucchi for Artemide.  They
definitely know what they're doing over at IDEO, folks.
You should probably get one of those magic lamps right
away.</P>

<P>It's a pretty good discussion, but it's worth buying this
issue of WIRED just for the sake of the wondrous portrait
gallery on pages 176-177, which shows you what actual,
functional, no-kidding designers (and, uhm, one science
fiction writer) look like in real life. The legendary
Donald Norman, Paola Antonelli of the New York MOMA,
Lorraine Wild, David Kelley of IDEO, Bran Ferren, Chee
Pearlman, Tim Parsey of Motorola, Lee Green of IBM, Ted
Selker, Ray Riley of Nike, Tucker Viemeister, Ayse Birsel
of Olive 1:1....  A full set of blockbuster design
heavies, and they are all looking just great! (Even though
none of them have their top buttons buttoned, as designers
normally do.) I am frankly besotted with these people!
They walk the earth like colossi and should be treated as
demigods.  Anyone who gets in their way should be
immediately arrested.</P>

<P>Designers, who are the kindest, sweetest and most
civilised of human beings, especially if they are Lorraine
Wild, sometimes ask me why I, a science fiction writer,
ever came to hang out with the design crowd. Granted, this
doesn't seem at all plausible. So I tell them that story
of how, eleven long  years ago, I met my very first
industrial designer.  <STRONG>Tucker Viemeister.</STRONG>  "Oh, *Tucker
Viemeister,*'" they always say, comprehension dawning.
"You met <STRONG>Tucker</STRONG>?  Okay, that explains everything."</P>
