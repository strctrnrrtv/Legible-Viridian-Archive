even California's politicians lost track.  Part Two of
Three.</P>

<P>"Genesis Of State's Energy Fiasco</P>

<P>"String of bad decisions on deregulation could end up
costing consumers $40 billion</P>

<P>"Next month, about 10 million Californians may begin
paying as much as 30 percent more for electricity, in a
maddening coda to one of the most costly public policy
mistakes ever made.</P>

<P>"When the state's leaders started moving the energy system
toward deregulation six years ago, they envisioned a brand
new day in which utility companies' long-standing monopoly
would be broken and rates would decline by as much as 25
percent.</P>

<P>"Instead, when it is over, it may cost customers of the
state's investor-owned utilities $40 billion, perhaps
more. In the coming year, it could harm the world's sixth-
largest economy and send a ripple effect throughout the
globe for those dependent on California's continued
prosperity.   (((Nice move with the emotional blackmail
there, fella.  What about <STRONG>California's</STRONG> dependence on
<STRONG>everybody else's</STRONG> prosperity?  Who's going to bail you
out of this mess? Iowa, Wisconsin....  If there's a
federal bailout, California will be dependent on everybody</P>

"This is the story of what went wrong with deregulation,<BR>
and how planning lapses, serious policy blunders == and<BR>
warnings that came too late == set California's two main<BR>
utilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern<BR>
California Edison, toward a train wreck.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>"Power plant construction lagged while demand expanded.
Leaders misjudged how much competition there would be to
supply California with juice. And flawed deregulation laws
left utilities and their customers at the mercy of power
companies, extracting the highest price for electricity.
(...)</P>

<P>"In the early 1990s, businesses were fleeing the state
amid the worst economic times since the Great Depression.
Energy rates were 50 percent higher than they were on
average across the nation, because of commitments to more
expensive, environmentally friendly power and cost
overruns for nuclear power plant construction.
(((Electrical utilities are dirty and lack sexiness, but
they don't go away just because they're boring.)))</P>


<P>(((Here is the crux of the political problem with
deregulation.  It was so boring that the California
legislature couldn't stand it.  So they forfeited the
control  of their destiny to the one guy among them who
was willing  to do the grunt work.  His name was Steve
Peace, and he wasn't as bright as he thought he was.
Unfortunately,  since State Senator Peace couldn't get his
colleagues to  concentrate, he had to railroad the
bill through with oleaginous assurances that everything
would turn out just fine if they just crossed their
fingers and held their breath.  "Leap, and the Net will
appear!"  Every single one of them voted yes.)))</P>

<P>"Months passed while the discussion meandered and
faltered, and at one point it even appeared that no law
would be passed.</P>

<P>"That's when state Sen. Steve Peace took the reins and
tried to make something happen.</P>

<P>"The San Diego legislator already had won the respect of
his colleagues for his work on another complex piece of
legislation, reform of the workers' compensation system.</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"During a hurried two-week conference in August == dubbed<BR>
the 'Steve Peace death march' for his propensity to keep<BR>
negotiators at the table late into the night == the fine<BR>
points of the energy law were hashed out.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>"Legislators entrusted their judgment to Peace and the few
colleagues who worked on the bill. There was an abiding
sense by a number of participants that few members of
either house knew what was in the bill or even understood
it. (((The dotcom approach to governance.))) It was passed
by both houses of the Legislature  unanimously and signed
into law the following month.</P>

<P>'People were grateful to Peace and (former Sen. Diane)
Martinez for taking it on,' said Debra Bowen, D-Los
Angeles, the current chair of the Senate energy committee.
'Historically, utilities were a pretty boring topic, and I
think term limits factored into it.'</P>

<P>(((This is really funny, isn't it?  It's chucklesome
thing, very  human.  The authorities ceded any real
understanding of  their genuine predicament, tried to
handwave their way out it, and death-marched the</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>population straight off a cliff in a haze of inattention.<BR>
But it's not entirely funny == because that's exactly what<BR>
we're doing to ourselves with the Greenhouse Effect.)))<BR></P>
