<P>Attention Conservation Notice: Pope's hyperkinetic
magazine appearances overloading readers' patience;
papercuts proliferate, eyeballs beginning to bleed</P>

<P>A New Viridian Individual Project:
by spiff@bway.net^^^^^^** (Spiff)
Spiff made a weather-related home movie.  Nice punchline.

<P>We Viridians still haven't figured out "who" "drew"
the new BP Helios logo, but our investigators are
hot on the trail.</P>

<P>"Have you ever said to yourself, 'I wish our company had a
more dynamic name'? Or,'If only our logo was more
expressive'? Or, 'Is our tagline catchy enough?" If so,
eNormicom's patented Image Bucket Program(TM) is the
answer."

  The February 2001 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction
  magazine is on the stands.  I'm in it.

<P>Normally I don't trouble readers of Viridian List with my
science fiction publications, but this particular story of
mine, called "User-Centric," is of Viridian interest.  Set
in the future and dealing with ubiqitous computation, it
involves a hard-working cadre of postindustrial designers.
This "design fiction" story first appeared in DESIGNFAX,
where it looked even more peculiar and unclassifiable than
it does in ASIMOV'S.</P>

<P>After anguished moral struggle and much impassioned
argument before the High Court, Judge Natalie Jeremijenko
has settled matters and given us a winner!  The victorious
candidate is:
<BR></P>

<P>"The New World Order Firing Squad</P>

<P>"An automated firing squad confronts a large, bounding
balloon in an installation shooting gallery.  The guns
dramatically respond to the keywords 'Ready,' 'Aim,' and
'Fire.'  On 'ready' the guns chamber a round, on 'aim'
they unsteadily converge at the target, and at 'fire' they
shoot pellets.  But the cybernetic guns cannot be directly
touched, are unbearably quirky, and are frequently
disobedient.  Furthermore, the balloon itself is
surprisingly tough and slippery, bounding around at random
directions and speeds.   The intent of this installation
is to increasingly excite and frustrate an ever-growing
and ever-more-bloodthirsty crowd, demanding the balloon's
annihilation.  The frantic voices are recorded and played
back after the balloon finally meets its end."</P>

<P><BR>
Accepting the crown for his heartbreaking work of
staggering genius is: <A HREF="mailto:bruces@well.com">bruces@well.com</A>  (Bruce Sterling).
Bruce has graciously agreed to give us a few words about
his insightful work of technosocial criticism.</P>

<P>Bruce Sterling (sobbing unevenly, clutching tiara to his
head and shifting unwieldy bouquet):</P>

<P>"Somehow I always darn well knew that this grand prize
would most definitely end up here in my political base of
Austin....  Ever since I started up the massive
fundraising for this contest, I played to win! I most
definitely deserve this victory, which by all rights
should have been mine several weeks ago. So I just want to
thank Supreme Judge Natalie, and my extensive family,
especially my brother the Governor, and that attractive
Attorney General, and the majority in the Florida House,
and the minority on the Florida Supreme Court, and Fox
News cable, and, most especially, the designer of the
Vote-o-Matic.  Thank goodness that our long ordeal is
over. Now everyone in our Viridian feudal theocracy can
once again unite behind the Pope-Emperor."</P>

<P>Bruce Sterling's prize is a handy digital tape recorder.
This blobject gizmo will probably see a lot of use at the
upcoming New Years Party.  Viridians who have sent in
their RSVPs for this party will be receiving directions
shortly.  If you also want to attend, do let me know.</P>
