  "It might be good news for surfers, but it's bad news for
  everyone else. Waves are getting bigger, says Ibgo
  Grevemeyer of the University of Bremen in Germany. He and
  his colleagues analysed records of seismic activity from
  Hamburg between 1954 and 1998, looking faint background
  noise caused by the pounding of ocean waves. After 1978,
  wave heights increased significantly, they found. (Nature,
  vol 408 p 349) The changes correlate with more violent
  storms in the North Atlantic and a rise in global
  temperatures in the same period. 'We now have additional
  data that shows a profound climate change in the late
  seventies,' Grevemeyer says. 'It's a kind of warning for
  humankind.'

"World's First Wave Generated Power Station Opens
<BR></P>

<P>"INVERNESS, Scotland, November 21, 2000 (ENS) == The
world's first commercial wave power station has been
connected to the national grid in Britain. WAVEGEN and
Queen's University Belfast jointly developed the LIMPET
(Land Installed Marine Powered Energy Transformer) wave
system with financial support from the European Union.
<BR></P>

<P>"The LIMPET is operating on the Island of Islay, off
the West coast of Scotland, famed for its unique whisky
distilleries.  (((Yee-haw! Green-powered single-malts!)))
<BR></P>

<P>"This first site will generate 500 kW of renewable
energy without greenhouse gas emissions. That capacity is
sufficient for 400 local homes. (((Or one distillery,
maybe.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"'This is a big day for us,' says managing director
Allan Thomson. 'Wave power has joined the important group
of commercially viable, competitive and clean forms of
sustainable energy. This is the launch of a new global
market.'
<BR></P>

<P>"LIMPET offers modular construction and simple
operation, and company officials predict its applications
will fill a growing need in coastal communities around the
world that are trying to replace diesel generation. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>"The LIMPET uses an oscillating water column in an
inclined concrete tube that has its opening below the
water level. Wave action causes the water level in the
collector to oscillate, and this variation alternately
compresses and decompresses the trapped air in the column.
The air flows back and forth through a pair of generating
turbines which are driven in the same direction at all
times, regardless of the direction of the airflow.
<BR></P>

<P>"The unit is designed to operate on the shoreline, or
it can be incorporated within rubble mounds or caisson
breakwaters to provide coastal protection schemes as well
as power generation.
<BR></P>

<P>"Key features include low cost power, maximum local
content and 60 year life with minimal maintenance.
(((Hands up everybody who thinks the shoreline of Scotland
is still going to be there in 60 years.)))
<BR></P>

<P>(...) "WAVEGEN is backed by UNOTEC Holding AG of
Switzerland, AGIP UK of Italy&sup1;s ENI Group, and the
European venture capital company 3i. The company was
established in 1992 by Thomson and professor Alan Wells,
inventor of the Wells air turbine."</P>
