<P>"'MACHINE OF THE YEAR'
TIME Digital Selects the Digital Camera</P>

<P>"FLIP ISSUE: Leading Science Fiction Writer Bruce Sterling
Guest Edits An Issue of TIME Digital == Written for the
Year 2026. (...)</P>

<P>"In the new issue of TIME Digital, the monthly consumer-
tech magazine from The TIME Group of magazines:</P>


<P>"Bruce Sterling, a leading science fiction writer, guest
edits a 'flip' issue (see our second back cover) as if the
date were January 2026  and parodies TIME Digital's look
and feel. The stories were written by Sterling, members of
an Internet mailing list he runs dedicated to the future,
and Lev Grossman, of TIME Digital. Most of the objects
that appear in the magazine's features and reviews were
rendered from scratch by computer artists == like the
imagined Swatch Body Clock watch that does your bloodwork
each day, or the Palm K-9, the first pawtop computer for
dogs.</P>

<P>"TIME Digital (circulation 1 million) includes
investigative stories from the frontlines of technology,
profiles, and the latest in products and trends.  Joshua
Quittner is managing editor.  Check out its website,
timedigital.com, and Quittner's daily TIMEtech reports on
the CBS Radio Network."</P>

<P>(((Bruce S remarks:  The January 2001/2026 TIME Digital
issue has just hit the stands, and thanks to massive
Viridian input, it is without question one of the
weirdest, coolest publications you will ever see.  Our
parodized version of 2026 was constructed by myself and
Viridian fellow-travellers Stefan Jones and Carol Cooper,
with help from the multitalented David Rice of
FutureFeedForward (<A HREF="http://www.futurefeedforward.com">http://www.futurefeedforward.com</A>) and
the wise and hardworking Lev Grossman of Time Digital.</P>

<P>(((This imagined world of 2026 looks, smells and acts like
an everyday magazine from a future Viridian society.  The
issue swarms with Viridian "imaginary products," Viridian
"sewerspace," a Viridian dream home, and even a Viridian
political scandal.  Fans of Bruce Sterling's science
fiction novels will also notice an incessant string of
injokes.  Go out pronto and buy every copy you can get
your hands on. It's beautiful, it rocks and it's the year
2000's top Viridian collectors' item.  In fact, while
you're at it, go click on TIME Digital's website and build
up their hitcount to staggering proportions:

<P><U>PARTY INVITATION</U><BR></P>

<P>It's a lively season at the Viridian Vatican in Austin, as
Green-powered Xmas lights strew the "backyard
biodiversity" of the so-called lawn, and Texan politicians
writhe in agony over a fatally flawed election.</P>

<P>We plan to finish the year 2000 with a drunken cheer at
the "Mathematically Literate Millennium Party," where
those of us who can successfully count from zero will be
celebrating the arrival of the actual, no-kidding
millennium.  We will also gently mourn the long-awaited
passing of 2000 A.D., truly a bonanza year for futurist
pundits!</P>

<P>The Vatican doors will be open to all Viridians  (a
perfectly safe offer to make, since so many of you are
marooned on distant continents).  However, we do need a
headcount of our expected guests.  We therefore ask you to
email <A HREF="mailto:bruces@well.com">bruces@well.com</A> and indicate your intention to show
up for New Years.  On receiving your digital RSVP, I will
mail you directions and such.</P>
