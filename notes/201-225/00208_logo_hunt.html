  We solemn Viridians don't really approve of

  hilarious.

<P>(((Back in Note 00203, we were discussing the new,
cybergreen logo of bp, the world's coolest, greenest,
sexiest, massive carbon-spewing oil supermajor megacorp.
BP's new Helios logo was created by "Landor Associates,
San Francisco office," a subdivision of Young and
Rubicam.  Presumably, however, there was some <STRONG>actual
human being</STRONG> quietly  sitting at some console and
<STRONG>drawing</STRONG> that new BP "Helios"  logo.  We Viridians want
to know who this guy is.  We figure him for some kind of
invisible culture hero.  We want to send him fan mail.)))</P>

<P>Using good old Google (<A HREF="http://www.google.com/">www.google.com</A>), and searching for
"bp logo designer" several links point to an article at
designinmotion. The actual link is:
<A HREF="http://www.designinmotion.com/article/mainv/0,7220,113933,00.html">http://www.designinmotion.com/article/mainv/0,7220,113933,00.html</A></P>

<P>Toward the bottom of the article it lists several of the
people involved. Heath Ivan Hewett is listed as "Designer"
so perhaps he is the person responsible for the new
design.</P>

<P>Wesley M. Gifford <A href="mailto:giffow@rpi.edu">giffow@rpi.edu</A></P>

<P>(((This Design in Motion piece is a terrific article on
the awe-inspiring Ogilvy and Mather bp television spot.
It doesn't say anything about the guy who actually drew
the logo, however.  It can't be Heath Ivan Hewitt because
he works for Charlex in New York, not Landor in San
Francisco.)))</P><!-- Outputting auto-detected mail header as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"I just spoke to Steven LaPaz (sp?) at:
Landor Associates Corporate Headquarters
Klamath House, 1001 Front Street
San Francisco, CA 94111 USA</P>

WEB  <A HREF="http://www.landor.com/">http://www.landor.com/</A></P>

<P>"I received the answer that the designer that did it is no
longer at the company.  Mr. LaPaz didn't know where he was
working, and did not know if he was allowed to give out
his name, and would not do so to me.  I have an email into
the company's website, but somehow I expect the same
answer.</P>

<P>(((But the enterprising MarcErickson did get an answer to
his email, of sorts.)))</P>

<P>"Hi Marc.</P>

<P>"Thank you for your interest in Landor's work with BP.
Development of the BP mark was the collaborative work of
several Landor designers &amp; brand strategists located
throughout Landor's worldwide network. Also, this type of
information is somewhat proprietary.</P>

<P>"If there is particular information you would like about
Landor's range of services, industry work or even
additional details on the BP program, please let me know.
I have attached a PDF version of our brochure, in case you
are interested in viewing some of our past work.</P>

<P>"Best regards,</P>

<P>(((Wow. It's PROPRIETARY!  They really don't want us to
know!  It's a genuine MYSTERY!  Maybe the guy was FIRED!
Or, maybe he just jumped for greener pastures.)))</P>

  <P>"'Courtney is a wonderful addition to the 
        Interbrand team,' Chuck Brymer, CEO, Interbrand  Group, said. 'Not
only does he have a great record in working with clients
to maximize the value   of traditional brands, he has keen
insights on the Internet's dramatic impact on branding and
brand value management.'  (((Hey, with a skill-set like
that, money's no object!)))

  <P>"Reeser worked at Landor for seven years. Prior 
        to Landor, Reeser was a principal of his own  firm, The
Reeser Group.  Previously, he worked at the San Francisco-
based design firm SBG Enterprise. Reeser received his
degree in graphic design/packaging from The Art Center
College  of Design in Pasadena after studying architecture
at California Polytechnic State University.  (((Gotta
admit that this sounds like the proper resume' for the
job.)))

<P>(((This Reeser guy must have had <STRONG>something</STRONG> to do with
the bp logo. But did he <STRONG>draw</STRONG> it?  Somehow it's hard to
imagine Mr Reeser actually piloting a  Koala Pad from the
rarefied heights of "creation, enhancement, maintenance
and valuation."  I suppose that someone could just call
him up and <STRONG>ask</STRONG> him....)))</P>

<P>Bruce:</P>

<P>"Thanks to some Spanish chitchat with Landor's
receptionist here in San Francisco (su nombre es Annie), I
was able to find the name of the project manager who was
involved in creating the logo you have come to adore and
be inspired by.</P>

<P>"The dude is Greg Barnell and he informed me that this
logo in question was arrived at 'through the collaborative
efforts of a bunch of different people over the course of
about a year.'</P>

<P>"Not very descriptive indeed (I'm sure he didn't spill the
beans entirely and fed me 'the official script') but maybe
you can give him a call directly via Annie the cool
receptionist. Ye number:</P>

<P>(((Hmmm. Maybe we're really looking for 50 guys.  This
hardbitten graphics veteran offers counsel on the grim
realities of modern logo generation.)))</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"While there were certainly a handful of 
        designers fiddling with final variations of the new logo in Adobe
Illustrator on G4 Macintosh computers, the process of
drawing the logo was probably way muddy and organic.  I
have been working for siegelgale for a few years, watching
new logos and corporate identities 'form', or whatever. At
Landor, they certainly have 300 books of design
inspiration to copy ideas, at least 30 books on logotypes
and marks and such. The designers may have five books at
their desk that are all images of symmetric round motifs,
such as Helios. Maybe their book has this star with 16
points instead of 18, or four concentric patterns instead
of three.
<BR>       </P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"At siegelgale, even a little $100,000 logo-only 
        job will START with 200 designs, which will be mixed, matched, and 
        muddled with each other into hundreds of versions. Ok, sometimes, when 
        it gets down to the final three to show the client, one is generated by 
        'somebody' the night before. Some of the more unique logo marks have 
        parts that were actually 'drawn' by someone. But gosh, the Helios thing 
        wasn't drawn by someone, it came off a floor in London at BP 
        headquarters. Someone brought it to life, 'dramatized' it, saw and told 
        the story to their boss, who embellished and bent it, before a handful 
        of very wealthy men who were in charge of paying for it. The color is a 
        major part of this story, and I would love to hear that part as well. 
        With colors that are interesting, vivid, and different from the rest, 
        there must be $50,000 of rationale in this logo's color alone! ps, 
        thanks for the mailing list, even the 'movement' I guess. It is awesome."</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(((Thanks for the compliment, "joel," or whatever entity
it is that you actually are.  Maybe it was entirely
romantic and backward of me to imagine that there was some
individual mediating this massive industrial process.
Probably, the logo's creator <STRONG>didn't</STRONG> get fired by Landor,
so he <STRONG>isn't</STRONG> dodging his rent payments and slowly
starving like a forgotten dog while mooching around San
Francisco, writing self-pitying web-designer
autobiographical web comics such as:
<A HREF="http://e-sheep.com/almostguy/">http://e-sheep.com/almostguy/</A></P>


<P>(((But what if he <STRONG>is</STRONG> doing that, you know?  What if he's
had a total nervous breakdown and can't even <STRONG>pay for
gas</STRONG>? What a story that would be, huh? Wow!</P>

<P>(((Perhaps the next step is to have a closer look at the
thing that is actually on the floor at British Petroleum
headquarters in London.  Who will be kind enough to go
photograph that for us, scan it and email it in?)))</P>
