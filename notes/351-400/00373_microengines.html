<P>I'm having a Turkey City writer's workshop at
the Viridian Vatican this Saturday, June 28, 02003.

<P>We'll have an open party after the workshop, starting
around 7:30 PM or so.  Want to come drink beer with
science fiction writers?  Send me email!</P>

<p>
You might well like to meet our distinguished
out-of-town  guest of honor, Eileen Gunn.

<P>Eileen Gunn edits "Infinite Matrix," where I have
a weblog.  Give her money; we'll buy beer with it.

<P>Surprise guest, legendary short-story writer
Howard Waldrop, will also be here for Turkey City.
Howard hasn't lived in Texas for years, but now, well, he
does.

<h3>"Engineers Develop Microengines: The Batteries of the
Future"</h3>

<P>17/06/2003</P>

<P>"University of Birmingham engineers have developed tiny
engines only a few millimetres wide that will soon replace
a standard battery."  <font color="green">((("Soon?")))
</p>

<P>"These micro-engines have over 300 times more energy
than an ordinary battery and are much lighter and smaller.
These new power-supplying machines will soon be used to
charge mobile phones and lap top computers in a matter of
seconds thereby eliminating the need to recharge them
frequently.
</p>

<P>"Dr Kyle Jiang,  <font color="green">(((what a great 21st century scientist
name))) lead investigator from the department of
Mechanical Engineering, says, 'These micro-engines will be
much more energy efficient than standard batteries. It
takes 2000 times more energy to manufacture a battery than
the battery dispenses while it is being used. Soon
everyone will be able to charge their mobile phones
instantly using a shot of cigarette lighter fuel instead
of having to find a socket for a charger and wait while
the phone charges up'.  <font color="green">(((We Viridians have been
demanding this for years now.  Except we'd like
the fuel to be humanly drinkable, please.)))
</p>

<P>"Micro-engines will also be used during military
operations for driving micro air vehicles and micro-robots
for reconnaissance purposes;  <font color="green">(((I'm getting weary of the
ceaseless military-app drumbeat out of the R&amp;D community;
come on guys, you're British))) communications relays;
micro-cameras and other sensor carriers. Other
applications will include micro-factories &shy; tiny 'labs-on-
a-chip' that will be able to make drugs, chemicals or
small mechanical components.
<font color="green">(((Now we're talking.  Microchips that make drugs.
The LINUX Open Source Hashish Pentium, presumably.)))</P>

<P>"Investigators at the School of Engineering are the first
to manufacture these engines in a durable, heat resistant
material such as ceramic or silicon carbide.</P>

<P>"Notes to editors:
</p>

<P>"Moving footage/interviews of micro-engines is
available free of charge as a package to broadcast media
via Research TV, due for streaming on Tuesday 17 June. For
more details/to request footage contact www.research-
tv.com</P>
