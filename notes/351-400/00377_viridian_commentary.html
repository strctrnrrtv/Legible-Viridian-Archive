<P>"Hi Bruce,</p>

<P>"You forgot Canada (almost part of Europe).  British
Columbia, which was a rainforest until a couple of years
ago, is combating some 337 forest fires at the moment.
</p>

<P>"This is coupled with the out-of-control pine weevil
infestation which is devastating the northern BC forests
(the weevil used to be killed off in winter, back when it
was cold in the Arctic).  Things aren't looking good for
Ma Nature up here in the thawing North, but the Vancouver
Sun still has good powers of investigative journalism:
Apparently Canadian porn magazines are holding their own
against invaders such as Hustler Canada, even though
Hustler (<STRONG>gasp</STRONG>) doesn't use real Canadian girls, just
repackages 'Tara from Lousiana' to be 'Tara from Alberta.'
</p> 

<P>"It's good to see someone out there is still pursuing
hard-hitting journalism.  I just wonder where the paper to
print it on is going to come from."</p>

<h3>
"European Heat Wave</h2>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"Dear Bruce, dear beloved fellow members of the Viridian
Curia, dear Viridians &mdash; "Yes, this is Europe, and it is hot here. Germany'sNorth Sea and Baltic beaches deliver an nice and tasty 25- 
 27 degrees Celsius, but anywhere else, it is hell melting
over. And that's not just news of this week &mdash; the whole
year was a bit different.</p>

<P>"When we went kayaking in our folding boats 

<P>Link:<br>
<A HREF="http://www.faltbootbasteln.de" >http://www.faltbootbasteln.de</a><br>
<br>
<P>"on North-Hessian river Fulda during Easter Weekend,
we already encountered summer-like low water levels. Not
much surprise after over 4 weeks in Spring without any 
 rain. We even had to walk in the river bed alongside our boats a couple times &mdash; and that in a river described as navigable for kayaks 12 out of 12 months a year. The rain in over a month came on day two of our tour The first 
rain in over a month came on day two of our tour (of 
course).</p>

<P>"A month later, river Rhine seemed to be lower than
might be expected in May. The groins and wave breakers hadn't risen right out of the water, no, they don't do that &mdash; it's just the river was lower, so they were more exposed.</p>

<p>"In Spring, Germany already had about 20 forest fires
&mdash; nothing really big, nothing like British Columbia,
Australia or California, but still &mdash; forest fires in
Central Europe's usually green, dripping-wet Spring time!</p>

<P>"During the last few weeks, farmers had to haul in
their wheat harvest prematurely. After a lot of drought,
the grains weren't ripe and well-matured, they were small.
However, leaving them on the field would only mean that
the grains would fall to the ground, resulting in even
greater losses. So the farmers took what they could get,
which wasn't a lot.
</p> 

<P>"Ah, what do I care about a bad harvest? It's easy -
I eat bread. The math behind this is easy, too: Bad
harvest equals rising food prices, and that in a country
with a severe economic crisis and over 4 million
unemployed folks in a population of 80 million. On one
hand, everybody haggles to get taxes and health insurance
rates lowered and tries to free up budget for jumpstarting
the economy, on the other hand all those macro economic
effects are simply sucked up by a single bad harvest.
</p> 

<P>"Meanwhile in Stuttgart Zoo's 'Wilhelmina', an
elderly elephant, gets cold water showers every couple
hours to drag her through this summer.
</p> 

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"For this week &mdash; tomorrow or Thursday &mdash; the mercury
has been forecasted to climb to 40 degrees Celsius (for
all you Fahrenheiters out there: At 0 degrees C water
freezes, at 100 degrees C water boils and turns to vapor)
in my state of Hesse. Mind you &mdash; this is not the Baleares or some Greek island, or Iraq, where a British soldier
tried to dodge the local 58 degrees Celsius (didn't
someone say 'We'll all be out and gone by Summer', or does
my memory play tricks on me and that was the last time?)
by taking a nap in a big food freezer and was pulled out
hours later hypothermic and asleep, no: this is Rhein-Main
area, this is the land around Frankfurt, this is right in
the middle of Central Europe, where the grass stays green
all year round without being watered and needs regular
mowing.
</p> 

<P>"Good thing for all who commute by public transport:
Deutsche Bahn AG has some nice airconditioned trains
serving as RE (Regional Express). Bad news: Expect the
engines of the locomotives to go funky in this heat,
leaving trains stranded in the middle of nowhere. Or:
You're in a train with AC, and one generator fails. In
order to keep the arrival time so everybody catches their
next train, they switch off AC to reroute the power for
speed. And in those trains, you can't open any windows...
</p> 

<P>"River Elbe, running from Czech Republic through
Germany to the North Sea (and scene of last years
disastrous and deadly August flood) &mdash; is nearly dried up.
Passenger ferries have stopped running.</p>

<P>"The undergrowth and paths in the forest are dry, and
public fire warnings have been given. Open fires in
forests are forbidden. Already some forest fires have been
extinguished here in Germany in the last couple days.
</p> 

<P>"But we Germans are not the only folks who have it
hot. River Danube, the beautiful blue Danube which flows
from Germany through Austria, Hungaria and on down to the
Black Sea, has reached yesterday the lowest level since
115 years, according to ARD's Tagesschau. </p>

<P>Link:<br>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"They showed pictures of Danube in Serbia &mdash;
restaurant ships that were moored to the shore now sit on
dry land. But they wouldn't be able to serve their
traditional fish specialties anyway &mdash; barely anything
gets caught now. The Danube fishermen say this loss in fish population will still be felt several years from now.</p>

<P>(Q: What if another coincidental freak-heatwave hits
the fish-population before it recovers to pre-2003 levels?
And then another? And another?).</p>

<P>"Water-powered electricity plants were shut down to
preserve water for providing a shipping lane.  So much for
reliability of water-power in a greenhouse &mdash; soon, all we
will be able to rely on will be hot, dusty storms. Only
partially-loaded freighters can still navigate Danube &mdash;
and they only centimeters of water under their keels.</p> 

<P>"Forgotten history comes back to light.  The remains
of the German Black Sea Flotilla, sunk after the end of
World War I into the Danube, are normally all covered by
water. At the Danube's 'usual low levels' these shipwrecks
become a shipping hazard, but now the wrecks are so dry
that the cabins are visible, and in some parts even the
decks. A local explained that he had never seen them
before, only some tips of the ships during a severe
drought when he was a little boy, but never as exposed as
now, and then he went climbing onto the deck of one of
those former warships.</p>

<P>"Bruce, you mentioned French nuclear powerplants
overheating. I heard a feature on radio HR1 

<P>Link:<br>
<A HREF="http://www.hr-online.de/hf/hr1" >http://www.hr-online.de/hf/hr1</a><br> 

<P>"yesterday about the nuclear reactors on river Loire. Most nuclear reactors in France seem to line this single
waterway ("like a pearl necklace" &mdash; some kind of pearls
they got there!), and this summer their need of cooling is
immensely greater than ever before. So they draw more
water from Loire and return it with higher temperature
levels than usual &mdash; which led to a 5 degree Celsius increase in the Loire's water temperature compared to the
summer average of the last 25 years!</p>

<P>"Nice hot bathing water, one might say. Well, perhaps
&mdash; but anybody who is experienced with fish knows that
they unfortunately do need oxygen to live. The warmer the
water, the lower the oxygen levels in the water (also
diverse algae start to grow, some of which lead to
poisoning the water, etc. ...). Lower oxygen levels mean
lots of dead fish drifting down the river &mdash; just a change
of a few degrees Celsius in the average water temperature
is enough to give the residents in any given water the
final eviction note. Sure, you could introduce better
suited fish there later &mdash; and I guess French fishermen are already looking forward to catch some nice and funky
tropical fish soon, but until then, the base of their
income will be destroyed. The whole thing was commented by a chap from
Darmstadt's Oeko-Institut, so if anybody feels like
following up on this story, give them a call.</p>

<P>Link:<br>
<A HREF="http://www.oeko.de" >http://www.oeko.de</a>

<P>"And in the evening news, we were all presented with
real and true footage of French nuclear powerplant Fessenheim on river Rhine being cooled with EXTERNAL
SPRINKLERS &mdash; which supposedly lowered the plant's
temperature by 5 degrees Celsius, back into 'a safe
range'. Good for Fessenheim, good for everybody living
downstream. This was something very spectacular, something
that everybody can understand &mdash; and right in Alsace, on
our own border. (Second thought: many people didn't
understand Chernobyl &mdash; it was 'over there, where they
have all this commie mismanagement', and now this reactor
was 'in France, where they 'ave laissez-faire', so a
reactor disaster obviously couldn't happen here, or there,
or there, or in your country, or...)  Where can I get a
poster of that?</p>

<p>"Anybody really worried or surprised about the forest
fires in Southern Europe? Not me! For decades, folks there
did good business with arson &mdash; the guy who lights the
fire gets nice money, the guy who loses a forest gets nice
insurance cash and then sells this efficiently de-forested
land to a developer for more nice money. This is
supposedly how a lot of the hotel districts all around the Meditarranean got set up.  One week, a protected forest;
next week ashes; another week, construction site.</p>

<P>"In France, suspected arsonists already have been
arrested this season.  Tourists are sleeping in school
gyms, with their holiday homes and trailers turned to cinders. Lots of French, British and German tourists
cancel their trips, creating serious economic damage &mdash;
maybe this arson-based business model needs a new
approach, like including fire-insurance payoffs for the
tourists, so they may also be winners.</p>

<P>"But that's all small fish (or no fish at all, for
that matter).   What really worries me is one thing:
Remember the deadly Chicago heat wave of 1995 in the US?
There was a sentence in one Viridian Note, basically  saying: Well, why are Chicagoans dying in conditions that
give Texans only a yawn? Because they aren't used to it &mdash;
homes, clothing, habits and infrastructure are not adapted
to the climate.</p>

<P>Link:<br>
<A HREF="../../idsa.html" >http://www.viridiandesign.org/idsa.html</a></p>

<P>"This sounds like stark Darwinism to me, unfriendly
and cruel. As cruel as the byline in the news yesterday:
Besides suffering from headline-grabbing forest fires in
the Iberian Peninsula (for the geographically challenged -
that's Portugal and Spain, between Atlantic and the
Mediterranean Sea, that's right where German and British
sunworshipers go for generations to get their skin cancers
updated), now people there are dying from heat-related
causes. YESDATZRITE! These places were ALWAYS flaming hot
since El Cid's days, since Hannibal's days, and since
before that. Those folks lived there forever. The Spanish
and Portuguese know how to 'cope' with summer and serious
heat, they have cool, massive stone houses that don't need
air conditioning, they have siesta and they live the good
live and have good food and wine and merry songs and a  jolly party every night (and no, they don't wear
sombreros) &mdash; and now they die in their own country from
'heat-related' causes! Just like any Chicagoan! Or German!
Or Brit!</p>

<p>"That, dear Bruce, beloved Viridians, that is what
really scares me: Now those people who &mdash; together with
the Greek and the Sicilians &mdash; represent Europe's best and
time proven hot weather survival strategies are starting
to die from heat like any other guy.</p>

<P>"Dear friends, this is my report from Central Europe,
soon a scorching, efficiently de-populated steppe.</p>

<P>"With best wishes from Germany,</p>

<P>Alexander Schuth<br>
Rhein-Main</p>

<P>"P.S.: Last year's Czech and German floods, by the way,
were an extremely local phenomenon. As we were baking in
Cologne during Popkomm around 15th-20th of August, not a
single drop of rain fell. Meanwhile, other regions on the South-East of Germany and in Czech Republic got torrents
of water. This may still come again &mdash; and then it may be
considered handy that the levels of all rivers have been
lowered in advance."</p>
