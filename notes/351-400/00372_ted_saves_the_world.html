<P>"Dot-Com Saviors, Tilting at the World's Ills<br>
March 16, 2003 By KATIE HAFNER</P>

<P>"MONTEREY, Calif. WITH their sights set across the globe,
they are heading out from Silicon Valley with unflinching
optimism, buoyant self-confidence and, now that much of
their industry has evaporated, a great deal of time on
their hands.
<p>

<P>"In increasing numbers, high-tech entrepreneurs who
grew wealthy during the dot-com boom of the late 1990's &mdash;
as well as many who didn't &mdash; are turning the intense
business acumen they once devoted to making money to
working for what they see as the global good.
<p>

<P>"With the best of intentions, and maybe a hint of
hubris, these New Age saviors are trying to build water
purifiers, manual irrigation pumps, low-cost solar
collectors, hearing aids, even highly durable mosquito
nets.  (...) <font color="green" >(((Well!  Don't that beat all!)))
<p>

<P>"This new mood was especially evident at last month's
TED conference (for Technology Entertainment and Design),
an annual gathering in Monterey that attracts many of the
computer industry's elite. But instead of celebrating
technology's intrinsic beauty and financial potential,
participants showed off gizmos meant to improve living
conditions in the third world.
<p>

<P>"Instead of jargon like personal bandwidth, killer
app, and clicks and mortar, the notions floating around
this year were sustainability, the ecology of terror and
H.I.V. One of the most popular presentations came from
Dean Kamen, the inventor best known for the Segway Human
Transporter, the high-tech scooter that has yet to prove
itself in the marketplace. At TED, Mr. Kamen, 51, showed a
water purifier that also generates electricity. The
device, which resembles a Good Humor ice cream cart, takes
filthy water (all that is available to much of Africa, he
said) and distills it to crystalline purity.
<p>

<P>"'Here you take the box and put it directly where
someone needs it,' Mr. Kamen said. <font color="green" >(((Where's mine?))) His
device is still not ready for mass production, yet his
plans are grandiose. He said he would leave in the next
few weeks for Africa to explore distribution for his
invention.
<p>

<P>"TED was not the only place where world betterment
eclipsed return on investment as a discussion point. Three
weeks earlier, at the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, the annual meeting of world economic and
political leaders, a dinner for high-tech executives
focused almost exclusively on problems of poverty and
disease around the world. Bill Gates, the Microsoft
chairman, sat on a panel whose theme was 'Science for the
Global Good,' and discussed his foundation's work in
bringing immunization programs to developing countries.
<p>

<P>"While plenty of people in Silicon Valley are still
focused on keeping their businesses going, this change in
direction among some of the technology elite comes in the
aftermath of the dot-com collapse and the Sept. 11
attacks. Fear of terrorism and war, and general
nervousness about the health of the planet, seem to have
inspired a shift in priorities. Many of the speakers at
the conference were self-appointed Cassandras, describing
the dangers of American self-absorption with a fervor once
reserved for initial public offerings.  <font color="green" >(((Thank you so,
Katie Hafner, you noble soul, you... really, this stuff is
almost too good.)))
<p>

<P>"'Five years ago, people were too busy getting rich
and being dazzled by technology to think more broadly,'
said Chris Anderson, whose Sapling Foundation, which
finances medical, technological and educational projects
in the developing world, bought the rights to stage the
TED conference from its originator, Richard Saul Wurman, a
gregarious designer and architect.  <font color="green" >(((Even the conference
itself has been bought-out by profit-free do-gooders.)))
<p>

<P>"This year marked the 13th TED. Attendees pay $4,000
for three and a half days of intellectual soul searching,
mixed with some pure entertainment, like a juggling act,
and a generous dose of technological bravado.
<p>

<P>"The $1 million in profits made at this year's
conference will be given to causes devoted to clean water,
ocean conservation and public health in the developing
world, Mr. Anderson said. (...)
<p>

<P>"Some of the dot-com activists consider what they are
doing enlightened self-interest, perhaps even enlightened
opportunism. During the boom years, Bill Gross's Idealab,
an incubator for Internet-based startups, was churning out
online enterprises that offered toys, Web searches and
wedding planning. Then the bubble burst, and many of
Idealab's companies disappeared. Mr. Gross's personal
wealth, $1 billion or more before the collapse, is now
roughly $200 million.
<p>

<P>"'Maybe since Sept. 11 and maybe because I'm almost
45 and maybe because I have four wonderful happy kids, I
want to do things that are important for the world,' Mr.
Gross said.
<p>

<P>"He used his time onstage at TED to introduce one new
Idealab venture, called Energy Innovations, which is
making inexpensive solar collectors to sell in places
needing cost-effective power. But he hasn't lost his
capitalist zeal, either. Eventually, Mr. Gross said, he
hopes to turn Energy Innovations into a money-making
business.  <font color="green" >(((It sure beats colonizing Iraq, plus you
don't have to explain things to bankers!)))
<p>

<P>"Like others at the conference, Mr. Gross criticized
the United States for consuming the bulk of the planet's
natural resources without regard for the hostility such a
lifestyle can engender. 'The root causes of any hatred
against the U.S. have to be dealt with, as opposed to just
closing our eyes to it,' he said.  <font color="green" >(((Yeah, who could
possibly hate solar collectors?  Hey wait a minute, I bet
Exxon-Mobil hates 'em.)))
<p>

<P>"Not surprisingly, perhaps, few of the newly socially
aware entrepreneurs speak of teaming up with public
agencies like the World Bank and Unicef, or even
nongovernmental aid organizations like Oxfam. Instead,
they focus on groups like the Acumen Fund, a social
venture fund that encourages an entrepreneurial approach
to fixing world problems. The Acumen Fund is receiving
$427,000 of the TED profits.
<p>

<P>"Jacqueline Novogratz, 41, a graduate of Stanford
Business School who started the Acumen Fund in 2001, said
she emphasizes models that take an investment-oriented
approach to global betterment, treating social ventures
like any other entrepreneurial enterprise. So far the fund
has raised $15 million.
<p>

<P>"As an example, Ms. Novogratz cited the Affordable
Hearing Aid Project, which has received $400,000 from the
Acumen Fund and others to manufacture and sell a $42
hearing aid in India. A comparable device would sell for
$1,500, Ms. Novogratz said. <font color="green" >(((Hey, I got a breakthrough
idea!  Why not get rid of those Big Pharma patents, and
treat public health in India as if it WASN'T an
entrepreneurial enterprise?)))
<p>

<P>"Though given as a grant, she said, the money is
structured like an investment in a startup, with
milestones and benchmarks to track progress. Acumen Fund
investors do not expect a financial return. 'But millions
of people are getting access to a technology they wouldn't
otherwise have,' Ms. Novogratz said, 'and for many, that
social return is as compelling as a financial return.'
<p>

<P>"The view from traditional philanthropists is
surprisingly positive. Dr. Richard Rockefeller, a
physician and longtime philanthropist (he is the son of
David Rockefeller), said he admired the pluck of people
like Mr. Gross, even envied their experience.
<p>

<P>"'I've often thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice just to go
be an entrepreneur,' or to do that first and get a grip,'
he said. Dr. Rockefeller, the chairman of the United
States advisory board of the international aid group
Doctors Without Borders, said he had encouraged his own
two children 'to go get a skill and do it before they go
out and change the world.'  <font color="green" >((("Skills'? Aw c'mon! What's
wrong with just standing here yelling, handwring, crying
and blowing smoke?)))
<p>

<P>(...)  "The latest version of the MoneyMaker, a
decidedly low-tech leg-powered irrigation pump, was
created by a company called ApproTEC, a nonprofit
organization that develops and markets new technologies in
Africa. It was designed in part by volunteers at Ideo, an
industrial design firm in Palo Alto known for the sleek
Palm V organizer and the Crest Neat Squeeze toothpaste
tube.
<p>

<P>"Since the first MoneyMaker pump was introduced in
Kenya in 1996, it has increased the average annual income
among farmers there who use it from $120 a year to $1,400,
according to Martin Fisher, a co-founder of ApproTEC.
<p>

<P>"Ideo helped design the newest pump, a deep-well
version that went on the market in Kenya last month, at no
charge to ApproTEC. Some 40 Ideo employees volunteered in
the evenings and on weekends for nearly a year.
<p>

<P>"'The pump is real, and helping real people,' said
Ben Tarbell, the 28-year-old Ideo project manager who
oversaw the pump's design.  <font color="green" >(((Boy, that's great news &mdash;
as long as the Kenyan water table holds out, that is.)))
<p>

<P>"Not everyone is embracing high-tech solutions like
Mr. Kamen's water purifier, or even more rudimentary
technology like the ApproTEC pump. John Wood, 39, quit his
high-paying management job at Microsoft around the time
the Nasdaq market peaked in March 2000, and started Room
to Read, a nonprofit group that brings books, libraries
and schools to poor Asian countries.
<p>

<P>"Since its start, the group has built 33 schools and
400 school libraries, delivered more than 200,000 books
and financed 122 scholarships.
<p>

<P>"'For the price an American pays for an S.U.V. or a
new Lexus, we could build six schools in Nepal,' Mr. Wood
said, sounding a bit like a commercial for Save the
Children. 'For the amount that a wealthy banker spends on
a pair of shoes, we could take a girl out of the
orphanage, put her in a school uniform, give her a book
bag and some pens, and send her off to school.'  <font color="green" >(((Where
she can become a lawyer and buy a Lexus!  Yay!)))
<p>

<P>"But will the commitment last? What will happen if
disillusionment sets in at the slow pace of social change?
Or if the next technology boom arrives?
<p>

<P>"One speaker at the TED conference elicited an
appreciative laugh from the audience when he told of a
bumper sticker he had spotted recently in Silicon
Valley. It read, 'Please God - Just One More Bubble.'
<p>

<P>"Mr. Wood, for one, said he had no plans to abandon
his project no matter what happens in the high-tech
business world. 'I plan to sit out the next bubble,' he
said. 'I don't care if the Nasdaq goes to 20,000. I'll be
in Nepal delivering books to villages on the back of a
yak.'</P>
