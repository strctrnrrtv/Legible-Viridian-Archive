<P><b>(((I have turned in the manuscript of my new novel.  This
allows me to return to  Viridian interests.  And lo
they exist in plenty. I might point out for that the sky
here in Austin has been steel-gray for a week due to
Mexican fires, while the rest of America had its most
active week of tornadoes on record.)))</b>

<b>(((But never mind mere planetary destruction. I've got
other fish to fry. Specifically, a new Bruce Sterling web
artwork commissioned for the digital gallery of the Los
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((That's right: Angelenos are paying me to create some
net.art. I couldn't refuse them this, because it looks so
great on my resume'. The theme of this forthcoming work ==
which will likely be titled "Embrace the Decay" in some
kind of nifty sub-Damien Hirst riff  == is media decay.
Specifically,  "Embrace the Decay" is an interactive
meditation on the dire relationship between typewriters
and the Internet.</P>

<P><b>(((You see, I am of the very last generation of authors
to work professionally on typewriters.  I get to be artsy
and nostalgic about this.  Typewriters are suffering
techno-obliteration now.  Viewers accessing this Sterling
artwork, "Embrace the Decay," will be typing on a virtual
typewriter which decays as they use it.  The
"typewriter's"  "paper" will decay, too.  Eventually this
digital artwork itself will no doubt vanish from human
ken, because hey, we are talking Internet art here.
(Okay, it might conceivably be saved, but only if Jon
Ippolito is reading this.)))</b>)</P>

<p>
<b>(((This contest is not strictly a "Viridian" contest,
because except for that Viridian design principle "Embrace
Decay," there's  nothing very Viridian about it.  My
feeling is that we  Viridians have suffered enough for a
while, so it's high time for us to have some fun here.
Besides, this is <STRONG>real art!</STRONG>  In a museum!  Wow!</P>

<P><b>(((My techno-art guru and collaborator, Mr. Jared Tarbell
of <A HREF="http://www.levitated.net/">www.levitated.net</A>, has invented a nifty Flash device
for us that will animate some decay.  We will be using
Jared's template for this contest.)))</b></P>

<P>You will need "the Flash development environment" to work
on this.  If you have never heard of this, well,
try anyway.

<p>
<b>(((Please note that this contest is by no means the same
as the consequent LA MOCA artwork.  I won't go into the
contractual obligations that compel this separation, but
it's real different, okay?   This contest even has a
contest judge all its own, and it's not me.  No!  Instead,
the Viridian contest judge is Lola Brine. Ms.  Brine, a
sharp-eyed young Austin woman of extensive net interests,
has such exquisite good taste in net.art that she is
Jared Tarbell's girlfriend.  All of Lola's decisions will
be final!)))</b>

<P><b>(((Note that this means that the winner of this Viridian
contest may not even <STRONG>be</STRONG> in the LA MOCA artwork.   We did
it like that ON PURPOSE. If I decide that your Flash decay
algorithm (or whatever the hell it is) is of some use, you
will be hearing from me <STRONG>entirely separately</STRONG> from this
Viridian contest.   In fact, you and I may get to know one
another rather well, by the time the artwork hits the web,
which will be in September 2003.)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((There is a whole lot of stuff in this art project of
mine that needs extensive figuring-out. Like, for
instance, I need an engineer who can hack Lego engines and
get them to a spray a fine mist of nitric acid in response
to web prompts.  Can you do that kind of thing? I so,
speak up.  I don't want any "Nitric Acid Contests" here,
because the casualty rate is too high, but if you grok
this stuff, you and I need to talk.)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((And, while I'm at it, I also need an aelopile.  Like,
a cute little desktop one.  Has anybody seen an aelopile?
Anybody want to build one?</P>

<P><b>(((Okay, let's get to the crux here.  The Viridian CONTEST
PRIZE!  Yay! Since this contest involves graphic efforts
to "rot" a virtual "sheet of paper," you'll  be getting a
lot of real-world use out of this prize:
a ROYAL MD100 Media Destroyer!)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((Your Royal "Media Destroyer" is a fully-functional,
high-security paper shredder. But it doesn't just shred
mere archaic paper!  Oh no!  The "Media Destroyer" also
handily obliterates CDs, DVDs, and floppy disks!  Win this
contest, and the Royal Media Destroyer will be shipped
direct to your home or office, anywhere on this
planet not under SARS quarantine!  Good luck!)))</b></P>

<P>This contest expires June 15, 2003.</P>
