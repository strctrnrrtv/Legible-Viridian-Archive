"Global warming may be bad news for future generations, but let's face it,
most of us spend as little time worrying about it as we did about al Qaeda
before 9/11. Like the terrorists, though, the seemingly remote climate risk

has become so real that the Pentagon's strategic planners are grappling
with it."</P>

<P>"In an article published Jan. 26 in Fortune magazine, Marshall released the
findings of an unclassified report‹written by Peter Schwartz and Doug Randall
of the Global Business Network‹entitled 'An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario
and Its Implications for United States National Security.'  <b>(((Viva GBN!)))</b></P>

<P>"The ONA-commissioned report, using the well-established scenario-planning
techniques developed at Shell's planning unit, generated a plausible future
scenario in which the thermohaline conveyor collapses in 2010. What follows
that oceanic shut-down sounds apocalyptic and yet the authors contend, is
quite plausible.</P>

<P>"By 2020, average rainfall in Europe drops 30 percent; 'megadroughts' affect
Southern China and Northern Europe; massive boatlifts of people from the
Caribbean attempt to enter the United States and Mexico; China is unable to
feed its population due to the combination of droughts and violent monsoons
and flooding; Eastern European countries invade a weakened Russia to seek
minerals and energy; nuclear India, Pakistan, and China go to war over water,
land, and refugees.</P>

<P>"In all 400 million people could be forced to migrate from uninhabitable
regions. In the United States, the East Coast population areas experience
severe shortages of freshwater; flooding creates an inland sea in California's
Central Valley and disrupts freshwater supplies for Southern California; and
energy disruptions are commonplace due to storms, ice and conflict. The
authors make the point clear: this is not a prediction, this is a plausible
scenario given what we know now."</P>

<P>"Exxon Mobil ordered to pay $6.75 billion for Valdez</P>

<P>"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) A federal judge on Wednesday ordered Exxon Mobil Corp.
to pay about $6.75 billion in punitive damages and interest to thousands of
fishermen and others affected by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill.</P>

<P>"Exxon Mobil has 30 days to appeal the order by U.S. District Judge Russel
Holland, who ordered the Irving-based company to pay $4.5 billion in punitive
damages and about $2.25 billion in interest.</P>

<P>"The money is to go to 32,000 fishermen, Alaska natives, landowners, small
businesses and municipalities affected by the 11-million gallon spill in
Prince William Sound.</P>

<P>"'We have now closed the trial court doors for the last time in this
litigation after 15 years,' said David Oesting, lead attorney for the
plaintiffs. 'We're definitely on track to the end of the entire dispute.'</P>

<P>"Exxon Mobil said it plans to appeal. Spokesman Tom Cirigliano said the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has twice vacated Holland's decision in the
case. The judge had been ordered by the appellate court to reconsider the
damages awarded in an earlier ruling in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision
last year about punitive damages.</P>

<P>"'This ruling flies in the face of the guidelines set by the appeals court,'
Cirigliano said."  <b>(((Unlike a burst supertanker, which merely

<P><b>(((From no less a man than Tucker Viemeister comes
the nano-future of shaving:)))</b></P>

<P>"On the eve of Gillette's introducing a new shaver, the Boston Globe
published our concept for future shaving that we called: 'Disposable micro razor pads.' 
You just wipe one of the pads over your face. Microscopic enlargement shows the tiny sharp 
cutting ribbons (like a mini cheese grater) &shy; but they are so small that they can't 
cut the skin, only 'grate' the ends of the beard. Next, look out for larger shaving pads 
for women (like mittens)!
