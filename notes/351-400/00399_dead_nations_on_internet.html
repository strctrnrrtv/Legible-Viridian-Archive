<P>"After that last Viridian note, I hereby prescribe you one listening of this short 
(26KB) MIDI file which I declare to be 'humanity's national anthem.' It's 'Einzug der 
Gladiatoren' by Julius Fucik, a nice old Austrohungarian military bandleader and student 
of Antonin Dvorak.  It is also commonly known as 'the clown music.'"

<h2>"Niue is dead! Long live .nu!"</h2>

<P>By Kieren McCarthy</P>

<P>"Posted: 15/01/2004 at 21:39 GMT</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"The tiny island of Niue was all but wiped off the map at the end of last week when 
  cyclone Heta sent 300kph winds and 20-metre waves smashing into a population of just 1,200 
  people.</P>

  <P>"Now, with many islanders deciding to move to nearby New Zealand, there is a question 
  over Niue's independence, granted in 1974 when the population was closer to 5,000. It is 
  expected that only 500 people will remain.</P>

  <P>"One of the peculiar aspects of the world's smallest independent state and world's 
  largest coral island however is how it has traditionally made its money. Aside from the 
  NZ$8 million the New Zealand government gives it annually in aid and the sale of passion 
  fruit, lime oil and coconut cream, an important source of revenue has always been the sale 
  of postage stamps to foreign collectors &ndash; the vast majority of whom will never visit the 
  island.  <b>(((I enjoy the Register's acerbic British commentary so much that I can scarcely 
  bear to interrupt this.)))</b>
  </P>

  <P>"With this background, it is hardly surprising that the Internet has also become an 
  important revenue source for the island. Granted the .nu domain, Niue has set itself up as 
  the younger brother of Tuvalu (population: 11,300) and its successful .tv domain, leased 
  for 12 years for $50 million.</P>

  <P>"With the help of two Americans, over 100,000 .nu domains have been registered, 
  mostly to the Swedes since 'nu' means 'now' in Swedish. It also means 'naked' in French 
  but the French porn industry has yet to really cotton onto the domain.  <b>(((Surely just a 
  matter of time, especially if there is some kind of passion fruit, lime oil, coconut cream 
  and postage-stamp porn angle.)))</b></P>

  <P>"But with the island devastated, its infrastructure in tatters and its independence 
  under threat, many have started asking if cyclone Heta will also blow away a section of 
  the Internet?</P>

  <P>"The answer, categorically, is no. And this leads us to the fascinating and peculiar 
  world of country domains.  <b>(((Yeah!  This is the cool, geeky part!)))</b></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>"Sticking to the standards</h3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"The official rule, set up by Jon Postel in the early days of the Internet, is that 
  if a country is included in the international list of countries (International Country 
  Code Standard ISO 3166-1) then it is given a domain.  <b>(((How about the soon to be 
  mothballed "International Space Station" (dot-iss)?)))</b></P>

  <P>"It needn't be a certain size or a certain importance. It needn't even be an 
  independent state. If it was listed in ISO 3166-1, it got a domain. This has led to the 
  interesting situation that four of the 243 quoted country code top-level domains don't 
  even have anyone living on them."</P>

"It is easy to assume that the world of country codes is static and dull. Nothing is 
farther from the truth! Country code standards are a reflection of world events and 
international politics."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Bouvet Island (.bv) is nothing but glaciers. <b>(((Or at least, it used to be.)))</b> 
  Discovered in 1739 by the French, taken over by the British in 1825 and then handed to the 
  Norwegians in 1928, it was only in 1977 that anything stayed permanently on the island &ndash; 
  a meterological station.</P>

  <P>"The Heard Island and McDonald Islands (.hm) are completely barren. Handed over to 
  the Australians by the British in 1947, it does boast a few seals and birds, but Club 
  18-30 it is not.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Link:<br>
The hm. domain has a complete absence of alien plants
and animals, and, (before climate change) a complete
absence of human ecological impact!

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"British Indian Ocean Territory (.io) has a joint UK/US 'naval support facility' on 
  its biggest island, Diego Garcia, which sounds like the worst posting in the military. But 
  apart from that, not a dickie-bird."</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Link:
<br><a href="http://www.mydiegogarcia.com/">http://www.mydiegogarcia.com/</A>
Diego Garcia has birds aplenty, thank you.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"And the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (.tf) are as inviting as they sound. 
  Discovered by the French in 1840, the only people to set foot on it are researchers who, 
  get this, study the native fauna. <b>(((Might be a great spot for French atomic 
  testing!)))</b></P>

  <P>"Getting closer to Niue, we have the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (.cc) &ndash; sporting a 
  Olympic catchment population of 630. There are two islands where people live, but not 
  exactly in harmony. The Europeans apparently are to be found on the West Island and the 
  Malays on Home Island.</P>

  <P>"More incredible than that, Pitcairn Island (.pn) has only 47 people living on it, 
  doesn't even have an email connection and yet took its domain so seriously that a massive 
  row saw the UK government involved and ICANN approve a redelegation (done by post, of 
  course). The word you are looking for is parochial.</P>

  <P>"However, despite these oddities in using the ISO list of countries, the issue of 
  country domains is not quite that simple. Certainly when Zaire became the Democratic 
  Republic of the Congo, its previous .zr domain was removed and a new .cd introduced. Plus, 
  when the Occupied Palestinian Territory was given international recognition, ICANN 
  followed suit and gave it .ps.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>"Do the maths</h3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"But there are 239 official countries in ISO 3166-1 and 243 country code top-level 
  domains. In fact, there are 244 country code domains in existence because even though .su 
  was marked down for deletion following the break up of the USSR in 1991 and doesn't 
  officially exist, .su addresses are still accessible and the domain administrators are 
  consistently trying to revive it, much to the annoyance of everyone else. <b>(((The Soviet 
  Union LIVES!)))</b></P>

  <P>"As recently as June this year, the 'Supervising Council of the Foundation' in Moscow 
  announced that its sunrise period for trademark registration had ended and now .su domains 
  were open to anyone under its rules and regulations. It claims nearly 30,000 registered 
  domains but in this surreal parallel world not everything is to be believed.  <b>(((Why is 
  that any less believable than any other Russian economic or political development?)))</b></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"The break-up of the USSR saw 10 new domains enter the world: in 1992, Estonia (.ee), 
  Lithuania (.lt), Georgia (.ge) and Ukraine (.ua); in 1993, Latvia (.lv) and Azerbaijan 
  (.az); in 1994, Moldova (.md), Russia (.ru), Belarus (.by), Armenia (.am) and Kazakhstan 
  (.kz).</P>

  <P>"However, in the wonderful flexible world that is Internet domain names, there 
  required no break-up of an empire for Great Britain not be granted .gb as described in the 
  ISO list but .uk representing United Kingdom plus four others dotted around the coastline: 
  Ascension Island (.ac), Guernsey (.gg), Isle of Man (.im) and Jersey (.je).</P>

  <P>"And if all that wasn't enough, from November you will be able to buy .eu European 
  domain names, as approved by the European Commission and soon to be agreed to by ICANN 
  once the details have been thrashed out.</P>

  <P>"Which leads us to the rather interesting thought about what the Internet will look 
  like in, say, 100 years. If everyone political movement and country that appears is 
  granted a new domain, and no domains are ever removed, <b>(((wait a minute &ndash; go re-read that 
  lede paragraph)))</b> not only will our ancestors be presented with the equivalent of .bb for 
  Babylonia but the artificial scarcity of domains that currently exist thanks to ICANN will 
  be wiped out. You only have to wait for the tectonic shifts in human civilisations."  
  <b>(((Let's not bring tectonics into this when a five-meter rise in sea level should 
  suffice.)))</b>
