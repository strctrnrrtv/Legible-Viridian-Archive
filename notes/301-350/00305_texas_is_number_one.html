outer space for a mere five billion bucks.</P>

<P>"Size, location make Texas No. 1 in weather deaths,
study says</P>

<P>"Tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, tropical storms
bring destruction to state (((Yee-haw!)))</P>

<P>By Dick Stanley, American-Statesman Staff
</p>

<P>"A new study underscores why meteorologists have long
said about Texas: Because of its size and location, Texas
consistently outranks other states in deaths and damage
from tornadoes and floods.
</p>

<P>"According to 'American Hazardscapes: The
Regionalization of Hazards and Disasters,' Texas
just misses the first rank in casualties and damage
from hurricanes and tropical storms as well.
</p>

<P>"From 1975 to 1998, all four weather phenomena
combined to make the Lone Star State the most storm-
hazardous place in the country, according to the academic
book for government policymakers published by the National
Academy Press.
</p>

<P>"The book, which also considers other kind of hazards
((("Utter boredom strikes Toledo, Peoria"...  "Minnesota's
Niceness Menace")))  was edited by University of South
Carolina geography professor Susan Cutter.</P>

Observer," "Natural Hazards Informer," "Natural Hazards
Review," etc.
<A HREF="http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/index.html">http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/index.html</A>
</p>

<P>"It says Texas accounted for 10 percent of the almost
9,000 American hazard deaths from 1975 to 1998 == because
of tornadoes, floods, hurricanes and tropical storms.
That was more than five times the national average and
nearly twice that of Florida, the second-ranking state."</P>

rising Greenhouse seas, Texas will still be here.

</p>

<P>"In those years, Texas recorded 442 deaths and $10.2
billion in property damage from floods, and 246 deaths and
$3.6 billion in damage from tornadoes.  The state was
second only to Florida in deaths == 30 vs 36 == from
hurricanes and tropical storms during tht period, and
third behind Florida and South Carolina with $3.6 billion
in property damage. (...)
</p>

<P>"As for hurricanes and tropical storms, the book said
Texans were hit by 16 of them from 1975 to 1998 == Amelia
in 1978, Elena and Claudette in 1979, Allen and Danielle
in 1980, Alicia in 1983, Bonnie in 1986, Beryl, Florence
and Gilbert in 1988, Allison, Chantal and Jerry in 1989,
Arlene in 1993, Dean in 1995 and Charley in 1998."</P>
