<P>SPOTLIGHT:<br>
"DIRTY BOMBS AND COBALT PENCILS</P>

<P>By Roman Kupchinsky
<BR></P>

<P>"How difficult would it be for a determined group of
terrorists, or criminals intent on nuclear blackmail, to
obtain the radioactive ingredient needed to construct a
'dirty bomb' and make the island of Manhattan
uninhabitable for 40 years? The answer, unfortunately, is
not so hard at all.</P>

<P><b>(((After this narrative hook, it doesn't get any cozier,
ladies and gentlemen.  If your blood pressure's been
spiking lately, you might want to stop right here.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"In the 'Report Card on the Department of Energy's
Nonproliferation Programs with Russia' issued on 10
January 2001, the blunt facts are all there:
<BR></P>

<P>"'The most urgent unmet national security threat to the
United States today is the danger that weapons of mass
destruction or weapons-usable material in Russia could be
stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation states and
used against American troops abroad or citizens at home.
This threat is a clear and present danger to the
international community as well as to American lives and
liberties.</P>

<P><b>(((Well, obviously the American hyperpower is the number
one target for this kind of antic, but should the Yankees
get dirty-bombed, don't expect that to make an end of the
practice.  The American population boasts more dirty-bomb
debris and better-educated terrorists than any other
candidates for mayhem.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"'Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, we have
witnessed the dissolution of an empire having over 40,000
nuclear weapons, over a thousand metric tons of nuclear
materials, vast quantities of chemical and biological
weapons materials, and thousands of missiles. This Cold
War arsenal is spread across 11 time zones and lacks the
Cold War infrastructure that provided the control and
financing necessary to assure that chains of command
remain intact and nuclear weapons and materials remain
securely beyond the reach of terrorists and weapons-
proliferating states.'
<BR></P>

<P><b>(((Yep, those are some pretty grim statistics...  The
USA is spread across quite a few time zones itself, and
should somebody truck-nuke Washington, the unparalleled US
arsenal will be just sort of, well, sitting there.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"The Department of Energy's (DOE) 'Report Card'
identifies the present danger. It was soon followed by a
February 2001 report to the U.S. Congress by the General
Accounting Office (GAO-01-312), 'Nuclear Nonproliferation
== Security of Russia's Nuclear Material Improving;
Further Enhancements Needed."
<BR></P>

<P><b>(((Why are our very lives hinging on documents with
such dorky, lifeless prose?)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"The GAO report by and large agrees with the
Department of Energy on the complex problems of having a
U.S. government agency approaching Russia, an enemy for
decades, and trying to instruct it on how to protect its
own nuclear stockpiles from theft. <b>(((Where's the Russian
Energy Dept.'s "report card" on the NATO stockpiles?)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"It was clear from the very start that the United
States did not have much faith in the abilities of the
Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) or the country's
Interior Ministry (MVD) to guard state nuclear facilities
from theft.  <b>(((Mostly because the FSB and MVD are major
packs of thieves, but that's another story.)))</b> This
correct assumption was bound to create enemies within the
FSB and MVD. The Russians == trained for decades to
believe that the Department of Energy was merely a front
for the Central Intelligence Agency, which was intent upon
stealing their secrets == tried to obstruct the project.
<BR></P>

<P><b>(((I wouldn't be so lame as to claim that the DoE is
the same entity as the CIA, but let me put it this way:
they're both obsessed with fossil fuels.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"They have been highly successful in their obstruction
in the past few years.
<BR></P>

<P>"The GAO study points out that: 'Because the Russian
Ministry of Atomic Energy has restricted the Department's
access to some nuclear weapons laboratories and civilian
sites, the Department is not installing security systems
in 104 buildings containing hundreds of metric tons of
material that it has identified as needing improved
security systems.' It goes on to say that 603 metric tons
of highly enriched uranium and plutonium is at risk of
being stolen.
<BR></P>

<P><b>((((Why not buy a personal Geiger counter and see if Al
Qaeda has stored some in your basement?)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"The materials at these civilian research centers,
naval fuel-storage areas, and nuclear laboratories can be
used in a nuclear weapon without any reprocessing. They
can be carried out by 'one or two people in portable
containers or as components from dismantled weapons.'
<b>(((Or, you can just hide them in a handy ton of Afghani
heroin.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"And while the DOE has installed security systems 'not
as stringent as those installed in the United States'
(which is strange, given the likelihood that terrorists or
criminals would attempt to buy these materials not in the
U.S. but abroad == most likely in Russia); they are
'designed to reduce the risk of nuclear material
theft at Russian sites.' The GAO report then concludes
that its investigation showed that: 'Russian officials'
concerns about divulging national security information
continue to impede DOE's efforts to install systems for
several hundred metric tons of nuclear materials at
sensitive Russian sites' (p. 27).
<BR></P>

<P><b>(((Or, you can ignore the Russian nuclear material.
You can be American, leave your Pakistani wife, step off a
plane in Chicago with some vague evil scheme of using
American trash for American dirty-bombs, and end up as an
American-citizen desaparecido.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"Having installed the instruments of security at those
sites to which the Russian government allowed them access,
the DOE and the Russian government need to keep them
operational in the long run. But how are those measures to
be assessed? Is the system functioning or not? In a
presumed reference to the Russian capacity for haphazard
monitoring (Chornobyl being the perfect example of a huge
'dirty bomb' released by faulty monitoring), the GAO
report goes on to say that: 'The new security systems'
ability to reduce the risk of theft also depends on
whether the site personnel operate the systems
on a continuing basis.'
<BR></P>

<P><b>(((It's a shame that this inept sentence destroys
that striking image as Chernobyl as a dirty-bomb avant la
lettre.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"This means constant monitoring of alarms, sensors,
cameras, and so on.  <b>((("Energy too cheap too meter.")))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"In 1997, the DOE turned to Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory to 'develop measures to determine the
system's effectiveness.' Scientists there developed a
measurement system, but it was not adopted 'because it was
too complex and time-intensive to implement' (GAO report,
p. 16).  <b>(((Maybe our <STRONG>whole civilization</STRONG> is "too complex
and time-intensive to implement.")))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"In an honest assessment of the situation, <b>(((huh?!
How'd <STRONG>that</STRONG> get in there?)))</b>  the GOA concurs with the
DOE and comes to the conclusion that the Russian side
'lack[s] the financial resources, adequately trained
staff, and the knowledge of procedures to operate and
maintain the systems effectively.... [M]any of the sites
cannot afford the warranties, parts, or technical support
necessary to ensure that the new systems are fully
operational' (GAO report, p. 17).
<BR></P>

<P><b>(((Who on earth <STRONG>can</STRONG> afford nuclear power, 
then?
It's too dangerous and complicated even for the ultra-tidy
Japanese.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"These are the results of official U.S.-Russian
efforts to prevent the theft from Russia of radioactive
components that can wreak havoc (by means of 'dirty' or
'clean' bombs) in whatever city a terrorist group targets.
<b>(((And if they're like the Khmer Rouge, they'll target
<STRONG>all</STRONG> cities just because they're cities.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"Despite these efforts, we must keep in mind that in
December 1998, an employee at Russia's premier nuclear
weapons laboratory in Sarov (formerly Arzamas-16) was
arrested for espionage and charged with attempting to sell
documents on nuclear weapons designs to agents of Iraq and
Afghanistan for $3 million.  <b>(((How did an "agent of
Afghanistan" get that kind of cash?)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"The regional head of the FSB, when reporting the
case, confirmed that it was not the first case of nuclear
theft at Sarov and explained that such thefts were the
result of the 'very difficult financial position' of
workers at such defense enterprises.  <b>(((Imagine being so
broke you need a big bribe from an Afghani.)))</b> The GAO
report states that only four of the 40 buildings in the
Sarov facility had completed or partially completed
security systems installed.
<BR></P>

<P>"But another factor emerges: old, discarded Soviet
generators used to power lighthouses and communications
equipment. Some 1,000 radiothermal generators, containing
radioactive strontium-90 or plutonium-238, are now
abandoned.  <b>((("Our Friend Mr Atom.")))</b> This was first
exposed by RFE/RL correspondent Jeremy Bransten on 21
March 2002 ('World: Danger Of 'Dirty Bombs' Exacerbated By
Old Soviet Generators,' rferl.org).
<BR></P>

<P>"In that report, he described how two cylinders
containing highly radioactive strontium-90 were found by
three loggers in Georgia. They turned them in to the
state. 'The cylinders were so radioactive, in fact, they
had melted the surrounding snow.' The cylinders were
disposed of by a team of experts from the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
<BR></P>

<P><b>(((Does this report of dead, moldering technology
surprise <STRONG>anybody</STRONG> on Viridian List?  Please raise your
hand if you are shocked, shocked.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"These radioactive generators are efficient, compact,
and can run for a number of years. Many of them have been
abandoned, and few recall where they were built.
Nonetheless, they remain unguarded, neglected potential
components of a 'dirty bomb.'</P>

<P>"WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO DESTROY MANHATTAN?
<b>(((Uhm... how about a cattle-call to become the
next cast member of "Sex and the City"?)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"Food irradiation is a common process all over the
world. It has produced enormous success in fighting hunger
and famine. It can also can serve a darker purpose: It can
be a provider of a simple ingredient for widespread
destruction.  <span class="greentext"><b>(((Mmm! Tasty!)))</b>MMM
</span>
<BR></P>

<P>"In a 1999 publication by the International
Consultative Group on Food Irradiation titled 'Facts About
Food Irradiation,'  <b>(((Subsection (C)(3): "How Food
Irradiation Destroys Manhattan")))</b>  the authors provide
the following information on the process:
<BR></P>

<P>"'The radionuclide used almost exclusively for the
irradiation of food by gamma rays is cobalt-60. It is
produced by neutron bombardment in a nuclear reactor of
the metal cobalt-59, then doubly encapsulated in stainless
steel 'pencils' to prevent any leakage during its use in
an irradiator. Cobalt-60 has a half-life of 5.3 years, the
gamma rays produced are highly penetrating and can be used
to treat full boxes of fresh or frozen food. Cesium-137 is
the only other gamma-emitting radionuclide suitable for
industrial processing of materials. It can be obtained by
reprocessing spent, or used, nuclear fuel elements and has
a half-life of 30 years.
<BR></P>

<P>"'However, there is no supply of commercial quantities
of cesium-137. Cobalt-60 has therefore become the choice
for gamma radiation source; over 80 percent of the cobalt-
60 available in the world market is produced in Canada.
<b>((("Blame Canada.")))</b> Other producers are the Russian
Federation, the People's Republic of China, India and
South Africa.'  <b>(((Models of civil stability!)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"Radioactive cobalt used in the process comes in
cobalt 'pencils' which are about one foot long and one
inch in diameter. According to a study by the Federation
of American Scientists presented to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on 6 March 2002 by Henry Kelly, if one
such cobalt pencil were exploded by a conventional
explosive (TNT) at the lower tip of Manhattan, 'No
immediate evacuation would be necessary, but in this case,
an area of approximately 1,000 square kilometers,
extending over three states, would be contaminated.'
<BR></P>

<P>"The residents of 300 typical city blocks would have a
one-in-10 risk of getting deadly cancers for 40 years.
'The entire borough of Manhattan would be so contaminated
that anyone living there would have a one-in-100 chance of
dying from cancer caused by the residual radiation. It
would be decades before the city was inhabitable again,
and demolition might be necessary.'  <b>(((Viridian
Involuntary Parks:  "Manhattan:  Skyscraper National
Park.")))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>'Facts About Food Irradiation' adds that: 'From 1955
to date, Canada has shipped approximately 480 million
curies of cobalt-60 without any radiation hazard to the
environment or release of radioactive materials. Over the
same period, approximately 1 million shipments of
radioisotopes for industrial, hospital, and research use
were made in North America without radiation accidents.'
<BR></P>

<P>"This is indeed a fine record, but when the booklet
was written in 1999, there was considerably less fear that
some of the cobalt being so frequently shipped might be
stolen.
<BR></P>

<P>"The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)
assures the public that: 'CNSC regulations prohibit the
disclosure of location, routing and timing of shipments of
nuclear materials, such as spent fuel. The shipment of
radioactive material is also governed by Transport
Canada's Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations,
which require shippers to have emergency response plans in
place.'
<BR></P>

<P>Is this enough to prevent the theft of a single pencil
of cobalt?  <b>(((Gee, I dunno... maybe you could steal a
pencil of cobalt from a blind man's cup.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"The Federation of American Scientists  <b>(((A bunch of
crazy leftists, so never mind them)))</b> concludes:
'Radiological attacks constitute a credible threat.
Radioactive materials that could be used for such attacks
are stored in thousands of facilities around the U.S.,
many of which may not be adequately protected against
theft by determined terrorists. Some of this material
could be easily dispersed in urban areas by using
conventional explosives or by other methods.'  <b>((("Au
Revoir, Belle Epoque.")))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"The U.S. DOE Task Force offers a sober assessment of
the present danger: 'Most of the cases involving the
successful seizure and recovery of stolen nuclear weapons-
usable material have occurred on the western border of
Russia.' In their estimate, the southern border is much
less secure == representing the soft underbelly of the
former USSR.  <b>((("Underbelly"?  Come on, it's <STRONG>all</STRONG> soft.
<STRONG>Canada</STRONG> is soft.)))</b>
<BR></P>

<P>"The armed conflicts in these regions and the
proximity to such states as Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan
makes it a no-man's land for potential nuclear smugglers.
The task force was further advised that buyers from Iraq,
Iran, and other countries have actively sought nuclear
material from Russian sites that could be used in
constructing nuclear weapons."</P>
