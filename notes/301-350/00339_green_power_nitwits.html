<P>"Solar woes shock SMUD
Published 2:15 a.m. PDT Friday, September 6, 2002
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The showpiece of Sacramento's electric utility, an
internationally known solar power program, is in shambles.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has fallen short of its goals, rocketed past its
budget limits, lost its long-term chief and left
Sacramento Municipal Utility District directors scrambling
to figure out how to salvage their commitment to renewable
energy.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The disarray could have far-reaching implications.
'For a long time, SMUD has been looked on as a leader ...
one of the nation's premier renewable energy programs,'
said Robert McConnell, a solar energy expert at the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo.
Other programs could face a harsher climate if SMUD starts
faltering and stumbling, McConnell said.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But others said the impact of even major turmoil at
SMUD will be blunted because the solar industry has grown
and insiders have long been dubious about the utility's
efforts.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Everyone with a real knowledge of the industry knows
that SMUD's program is smoke and mirrors' and has promised
solar systems at unrealistic prices, said Tim Townsend, a
solar subcontractor who studied panel quality at a now-
defunct research center in Davis.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Utility directors and managers say they remain
committed to keeping some kind of solar program. But as
internal audits showing the extent of the damage are
completed, they are not sure just what will be left.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already, SMUD has pulled the plug on any new
installations of solar panels at commercial sites for the
rest of 2002. It still will accept residential requests
this year for the panels, which convert the sun's heat to
electricity. But for 2003, nothing is certain == neither
the price of solar systems nor the pace of their
installation.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'It's a really miserable situation,' said Genevieve
Shiroma, SMUD board president. <b>((("Genevieve Shiroma of
SMUD" == what a great California name.)))</b>  'I'm really
shocked to hear that the program is basically in arrears.'
<b>(((Maybe she should talk to some California utility and
natural gas companies.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"SMUD had planned to spend $3.2 million in 2002 to
help homeowners, businesses, government offices and
nonprofit groups install photovoltaic panels on their
rooftops or their grounds. Instead, Thursday night the
board authorized spending more than twice that, at least
$7.6 million. It has been warned the tally may need to be
upped to $9.5 million if SMUD cannot persuade the state to
switch its stance on a solar subsidy.  <b>(((A million here,
a million there, it adds up.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that money will buy much less than SMUD planned.
The utility will get only 60 percent of the way to its
2002 goal of putting up another 2 megawatts of
photovoltaic, or 'PV' systems. It will install only 1.1 to
1.2 megawatts.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That slippage, and further setbacks expected next
year, will put SMUD well below the 15 megawatts of solar
power it once expected to have in place by 2003. (...)
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The troubles also have left the seven elected members
of SMUD's board wondering how things could have gone so
badly, for so long, without them knowing.  <b>(((Come on,
fellas.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Were these innocent mistakes, or were they
deliberate misrepresentations?' director Peter Keat asked.
<b>(((Paging Ken Lay, paging Andy Fastow...)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I would be reluctant to discuss that even in closed
session,' district general manager Jan Schori told him
during a committee session Wednesday.  <b>(((Shredders still
humming?)))</b></P>

<P>"Among the problems outlined for the board:
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The benefits of the solar program were double-counted
in budgeting, making the program appear $1.9 million
cheaper than it actually is.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Solar panels cost far more than projected, partly
because of delays and financial problems of a manufacturer
that would have been SMUD's cheapest supplier. Higher
prices from other manufacturers, sometimes up to 90
percent over budget, combined with delayed purchases,
drove 2002 materials' costs $2.4 million over projections.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Solar installations outside SMUD's area were
mistakenly priced below cost, in essence making SMUD
customers subsidize people in Davis and elsewhere.
<b>(((No problem there; in the recents brownouts California
subsidized the entire natural gas industry.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contracts with suppliers were changed in violation of
board policy and without board approval.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The district counted on qualifying for various grants
and subsidies that it didn't ultimately qualify for, and
that sometimes only existed as ideas outlined in pending
legislation.  <b>(((Paging Anderson Accounting.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several directors, who asked not to be named because
the discussions took place during closed sessions,  <b>(((oh
dear oh dear)))</b> said they were deeply disappointed by the
actions of Don Osborn, who ran the solar program from 1991
until departing abruptly into early retirement in
February.  <b>(((Fall guy.  Give 'em the gunsel.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Osborn, who now runs his own company called Spectrum
Energy, said the board is 'probably only hearing one
side,' and that he had long urged against some of the
decisions that left the program where it is now.
'I served the district for better than a decade with
honor, and I brought honor to the district and to
Sacramento. We are at the forefront of the solar
revolution,' he said.  <b>(((Paging... Oh, go find
Exxon-Mobil's defense lawyers, they must be pretty
good.)))</b></P>

<h3>"ENVIRONMENTALISTS VS. ENVIRONMENTALISTS ON LARGE-SCALE
WIND POWER IN CAPE COD</h3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For decades environmentalists have been calling for
wind, solar and geothermal energy to replace coal, nuclear
and oil-fired energy. They said, let's move to
environmentally safer energy sources and get off of the
highly-polluting sources of nuclear and coal-fired
electricity. The environmentalists said let's reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by going to energy sources
that don't produce GHG.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ironically, now that North America is moving into
large-scale, meaningful wind energy sources, some
environmentalists are opposing them too!! It's
environmentalists against environmentalists. The problem
is that you can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't
say no coal, no nuclear power, no oil-fired electricity,
unless you can provide an alternative, more benign energy
source.  Sometimes environmentalists can go overboard and
become their own worst enemies.  <b>(((Really? Wow!)))</b>
 </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take for example, the proposed new Cape Wind project.
It is the first offshore wind park in the United States
which will be built on Horseshoe Shoal, five miles off the
Cape Cod shore in Massachusetts. The wind park will
consist of 170 wind turbines, spread over an area of
approximately five-by-five miles. When completed in 2005,
at peak output of the project will  eliminate 4,642 tons
of sulfur dioxide, 120 tons of carbon monoxide, 1,566 tons
of nitrous oxides. The Cape Cod windfarm will reduce more
than a million tons of greenhouse gases, and 448 tons of
particulates from being dumped into the air from coal-
fired plants that the windmills would off-set.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it is true that any human-made structure like
windmill farms will cause some disruption to the natural
environment. Yes, looking at 170 windmills may be awe-
inspiring, but not pretty.  <b>(((Uhm, yeah.)))</b> But the true
environmental and health impacts are light-years lower
than the old energy sources that they replace. <b>((("Light-
years lower?")))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The local environmentalists now opposing the
construction of the windfarm have gone too far. What do
they propose as an alternative to wind, solar and
geothermal? Are they proposing more coal and nuclear power
plants with their serious human toxics? Are they
advocating no energy growth at all? Do they want to have
the US import more oil from OPEC? Or do they just not want
the windmills 'Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) == but in
someone else's backyard?'  <b>(((Wait a minute, I think
we've found our answer!)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit selfish, given world efforts to reduce smog
and global warming. For more information on the wind
project contact Cape Wind Associates, 75 Arlington Street,

<H3>"ALLIANCE TO PROTECT NANTUCKET SOUND IS FIGHTING WINDMILLS</H3>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound is the new
environmental group fighting the creation of the Cape Cod
wind farm. It is the one fighting efforts to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. The
organization states that, 'the proposed location is in the
middle of the pristine natural area that defines the
region and is treasured by millions of people. People do
not come to Cape Cod to see an industrial power facility
on an empty horizon."  <b>(((Well, no problem; rising
Greenhouse seas or a Force-5 typhoon will take care of
that unseemly "pristine" quality.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind industry has proven to be as destructive and
underhanded as any other power industry." <b>(((Dang!  Don't
that beat all!)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Further the group states that, 'people around the
world are challenging developers who cloak themselves in
the green armour of environmentalism while pocketing huge
profits and ruining the environment.'  <b>(((Yeah, they
probably are.  In fact, there are lots of "protesters" who
go counter-gunning against protesters against Exxon-
Mobil.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The organization has been able to enlist the help of
US Senator, John Warner of Virginia, who, they say, has
begun to question the wisdom of wind energy.  <b>(((Oh,
that's handy.  A pet Senator from a coal-mining state.)))</b>
"They report that Warner has asked the U.S. Corps of
Engineers to delay issuance of a permit for the first
phase of the Cape Code Wind Farm. What may be needed is a
high-level conference amongst environmental groups that
will resolve the environmental conflicts between those
advocating wind, solar and geothermal, and those opposing
it. Environmentalists cannot give mixed messages.  <b>(((Why
stop now?)))</b> Nor should they defeat themselves over
efforts to clean up the environment and reduce global
warming. <b>(((Why stop that either?)))</b> For more information
