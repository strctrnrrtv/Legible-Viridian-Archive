<P>(((I'm going to San Francisco this week to take part in
Computers Freedom and Privacy 2002.  Normally, my
abiding interest in electronic civil liberties rarely
appears on Viridian List.  However, I thought I would
feature this recent "Action Alert" from Electronic
Frontier Foundation, to show  how spirited these arcane
controversies are becoming,  this season.  In fact,
they're well beyond "spirited." They've got a distinct
tinge of Napoleonic warfare.</P>

<P>(((The US Congress crackles with deadly, crazily ambitious
new bills, meant to shut off the competitive oxygen of
various struggling monoliths. It's the land-based tigers
of Disney-ABC, the music industry and the movie industry,
versus the piratical nautical sharks of that Dell dude on
TV, who drives around in his Dad's "borrowed" car, playing
"borrowed" MP3s on Dell's hardware, Intel's chips and
Bill Gates's OS.</P>

<P>((Sooner or later this upheaval is  just bound to affect
Viridian operations, though whether we end up as a tame
subsidiary of Microsoft or a scary claque of offshore
dissidents is anybody's guess.)))</P>

  <P>ALERT: Act Now to Stop BPDG From Hobbling Digital TV<BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Hollywood Threatens Your Rights (Again)</P>

<P>(Issued: April 5, 2002 / Deadline: April 17, 2002)</P>

<P>Introduction:</P>

<P>Well, Hollywood's at it again. This time, the
entertainment giants are meeting behind closed doors with
key consumer electronics and computer companies. Using the
rubric of eliminating "piracy," this semi-secret group
will set the standards for over-the-air broadcast signals
of digital television (DTV), the new TV format that will
replace current broadcasts by the year 2006.</P>

<P>While the broadcasts will remain unencrypted, Hollywood is
determined to cripple the equipment that can actually
receive the broadcasts. Through the Broadcast Protection
Discussion Group (BPDG), an industry forum meeting in Los</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Angeles, Hollywood is writing a "technical standard" that<BR>
will restrict digital television equipment == TVs, VCRs,<BR>
personal video recorders, and computer "tuner cards" ==<BR>
capable of receiving digital TV broadcasts.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>The BPDG is determined to exclude the public from its
discussions. Members of the press are not permitted in</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>BPDG and CPTWG (Content Protection Technology Working<BR>
Group == BPDG's mother organization) meetings. In order to<BR>
attend BPDG meetings, one has to come (in person) to Los<BR>
Angeles and pay a $100 fee == per meeting. There are no<BR>
call-in numbers and no public minutes or records of what<BR>
takes place. In fact, in order to find out that BPDG<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>existed, you had to be a member of one of a handful of
trade associations, or be present in person at one of a
handful of industry conferences. There was no press
release and there is still no public web site run by BPDG
or any participating organization (except EFF). BPDG had
been meeting for months before references to it were made
in recent Congressional testimony regarding the SSSCA and
CBDTPA.</P>

<P>Let Hollywood's self-appointed technology cops know what
you think of restricting broadcast television!</P>

<P>What YOU Can Do Now:</P>

<P><BR>
EFF encourages you to write to the Drafting Committee
working on these rules to let them know what you think. To</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>date, the Drafting Committee has received only the<BR>
opinions of major companies == not of small businesses or<BR>
of users. You can read the drafts of the rules they've<BR>
promulgated (see below) and respond specifically to the<BR>
technical details. Feel free to use the EFF's sample<BR>
letter below as a starting point for your comments. You<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>should also feel free to write your own letter about
general issues related to BPDG's work.</P>

<P>Let the BPDG Drafting Committee know that you are
concerned about their efforts to control your use of free
over-the-air television broadcasts, and the long-term
effects of government mandates on innovation. Please be
polite and concise, but firm.</P>

<P>*Contact your legislators about this issue. For
information on how to contact your legislators and other
government officials, see EFF's "Contacting Congress and
Other Policymakers" guide at:

Sample Letter:</P>

<P>Use this sample letter as a model (please do not send it
verbatim), and send your own letter to:</P>

<P>BPDG Drafting Committee
<A HREF="mailto:bpdg-draft@list.lmicp.com">bpdg-draft@list.lmicp.com</A></P>

<P><BR>
Dear BPDG Drafting Committee:</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>I'm writing to object to what the BPDG is doing == meeting<BR>
in private to bargain away my rights as a consumer and the<BR>
rights of engineers to create the best possible products<BR>
for me.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>You're creating a future where innovation and consumers'
choices will take a back seat to copyright holders' fears.
You're setting a precedent for government involvement in
technology where open competition is set aside and winners
and losers are chosen, not by competition or by giving the
public a choice, but by a bureaucrat or by an "industry
consensus".</P>

<P>This precedent sets the stage for other mandates on the
design of PCs, software, and computer networks, with
implications far beyond television broadcast. Jack Valenti
is already talking about the "analog hole" and looking for
a new mandate to prevent digitizing-without-a-license. We</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>need to draw the line where it was drawn in 1984: if a<BR>
device == like a VCR or something as-yet uninvented ==<BR>
serves a legitimate consumer use then its manufacture,<BR>
sale and improvement is legal, even if it frightens Mr.<BR>
Valenti.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>I have the right to time-shift television programs, to
space-shift them, to format-shift them, and to use
technology to help me make the most of free over-the-air</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>TV programming. I should have my choice of any technology<BR>
that helps me make a legitimate use == and plenty of<BR>
manufacturers are prepared to give it to me.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>When technology companies want to build products that
enable my legitimate use, it's not your business to get in
their way. If the electronics companies represented at
CPTWG don't care to sell me the best possible products, I
want the right to turn to other companies who will
continue to put my interests first. Equipment subject to a
mandate is going to be less capable, more expensive, take
longer to invent, and prevent user-serviceability. New</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>devices under such a mandate will lack even the features<BR>
of currently available digital TV equipment == so you're<BR>
arranging for technology to get worse, not better.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>The standards you're creating have no conceivable
technical purpose except as raw material for legislation
or regulation; there isn't even the faintest pretense that
they're "purely technical" and free of policy
implications.</P>

<P>BPDG is working closely with people whose job is to get
what you come up with enacted into law. You're creating
legislation in private to spring upon us in the hope we
won't notice.</P>

<P>I should not be punished in advance for the possibility
that someone else will commit a crime. That's exactly what
technology mandates do; they undermine my rights even
though there's no indication that I've done, or will do,
anything wrong. They take away my choices. They impose
costs on me. They slow down innovation and give the
entertainment industry veto power over technologists. They
treat me like a criminal.</P>

<P>I don't want to be treated like a criminal.</P>

<P>Sincerely,</P>

<P>[Your name;
include full address for maximum effectiveness]</P>

<P><BR>
Tips:</P>

<P>Please remember to be polite but firm. Ranting, swearing,
or lack of clear focus and resolve will not make a good
impression. Try to make it brief (1 page or less written,
or a few sentences spoken) and clear, without getting into
nitpicky details. Re-casting the letter in your own words
will be more effective than copy-pasting our sample.</P>

<P>Activists Around the World</P>

<P>This alert is primarily for U.S. residents. However, this
issue is of importance globally, so keep an eye out in
your own jurisdiction for related matters you can act on.</P>

<P>CAFE Campaign:</P>

<P>This drive to contact BPDG Drafting Committee with your
objections to Hollywood control of digital media
technology is part of a larger campaign to highlight
intellectual property industry assaults against the
public's fair use rights, and what you can do about it.</P>

<P>Check the EFF Campaign for Audivisual Free Expression
(CAFE) website regularly for additional alerts and news:
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org/cafe/">http://www.eff.org/cafe/</A></P>

<P>Background:</P>

<P>Since the FCC has mandated that broadcasts will remain
unencrypted, Hollywood is determined to seal any device
capable of touching digital video in layers of tamper-
proof laws and innovation-dampening "standards." They call
themselves the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>(BPDG), and they're writing a "technical standard" that<BR>
will restrict digital television equipment == TVs, VCRs,<BR>
personal video recorders, and computer tuner cards ==<BR>
capable of receiving digital TV broadcasts.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>The standard BPDG is developing is a dense technical
document called the "BPDG Compliance and Robustness</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Rules". Here "compliance" means that a device will do what<BR>
Hollywood wants (as opposed to what its owner wants);<BR>
"robustness" means that it will be difficult (and<BR>
illegal!) for the owner to modify the device. The result<BR>
is that you'll get equipment which is less functional,<BR>
less flexible, more expensive, less interoperable, and<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>harder to fix, modify, or upgrade.</P>
