<P><img src="../../images/gbn_logo.jpg" alt="Global Business Network" border="0">
<p><A HREF="http://www.gbn.org" >http://www.gbn.org</A></P>

<P>Global Business Network are professional futurists.
Based in  Emeryville, California with colleagues
and clients scattered worldwide, GBN are future
wonks nonpareil. GBN has always been interested in
Viridian activism, and GBN has now ventured to
commission their own Viridian Design Contest. This is
gonna get pretty good, folks.</P>

<P>As commercial  futurati, GBN likes to throw seminars
called "learning journeys." They involve tours
of companies and production facilities, and
presentations by "GBN Interesting People" such as
myself, Laurie Anderson, Brian Eno, and even
more advanced thinkers (if such a thing is even possible).
Then there are futurist scenarios.</P>

<P>If you ever wondered why most science fiction novelists
write Galactic Empire trilogies, while Bruce Sterling
writes dense, spooky, complicated books in which
political campaign advisors have love affairs in Louisiana
with federal neuroscientists, well, suffice it to say that
Global Business Network has intellectual influence.
They were Global way before global was cool.</P>


<P>The next GBN event, starting in California in early
October, is <b>"BIOFUTURES: An Introduction to the Science,
Technology and Business of Biotech."</b></P>

<P>In this case, we Viridians will be an object lesson.
We will be teaching GBN's astonished clients how we
Viridians speculate about advanced biotech
consumerism in a Viridian design context.</P>

<P>And GBN's attendees &ndash; venture-capital types,
generally, with the occasional policy wonk or bent
academic &ndash; will be the JUDGES of this contest. These
people wear nice suits. They sign big checks.
They start-up high-tech companies. If they send you
email and hire you, don't say you weren't warned.</P>

<P>"Okay," I hear you asking. "A Viridian design gig with
corporate futurist sponsorship. What's in it for me?"</P>


<P>Great question, sir, ma'am! The astounding prize in this
Viridian Contest is &ndash; a <A HREF="http://www.sonystyle.com/home/item.jsp?hierc=9683x8031x9735&catid=&itemid=40658" >Sony Aibo Robot Dog!</a></P>

<div align="center"><img src="../../images/robodog3.jpg" alt="Sony Aibo Robot Dog!" width="200" height="221" border="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="../../images/robodog2.jpg" alt="Sony Aibo Robot Dog!" width="200" height="203" border="2"></div>

<P>That's right! It's an actual, no-kidding, commercially
available, sort of alive, robofuturistic, adorable
personal companion, <STRONG>just for you.</STRONG></P>

<P>Tina Estes, our GBN/Viridian Spokesmodel, has just broken
that baby out of the styrofoam blocks. She'll insert some
batteries into its entrails and make sure it's not a
factory lemon. Then you get to take it home and KEEP IT!</P>


<P>Just imagine the stunned surprise, not to
say uncanny Frankenstein alarm, when your own
no-kidding cute brown bulldog-oid
2002 A.D. Sony AIBO ERS-31L comes
into your room to greet your friends, frolicking
and blinking and, eerily, <STRONG>digitally photographing
any object it finds of interest.</STRONG>  Listen up,
Australians, Europeans, South Americans, Asians.
Global Business Network is a global network.
They'll cheerfully ship that expensive,
complicated robot anywhere on the planet.</P>

<P>Interested? Good! Because the Sony Aibo ERS-31L
robot entertainment unit, praiseworthy as he-she-or-it is,
is a mere shadow of our designer expectations. For
this <b>Biofuture Robot Dog Contest</b>, we want
you to imagine and design a similar
but <STRONG>vastly more advanced doglike entity,</STRONG> which
has <STRONG>nothing to do with the Sony corporation
or their copyright lawyers.</STRONG> This is no mere
cyberdog  device of period plastic, iron and
silicon. This is a biofuturistic, green,
way out-there ribo-bio-bamboo "dog", which is
transorganic, biomimetic, Viridian, enzymatically
postindustrial, and tissue-engineered.</P>

<P>Don't pretend that you are replacing a real dog. That
effort is useless, and even the "robot entertainer"
Aibo doesn't do that. This is a roughly dog-shaped
bio-entity.  It needs to enter some commercial
and cultural space which actual dogs and contemporary
robots cannot reach. What does a biofuturist paradog do
for  tomorrow's consumer? What kind  of society buys these
gizmos?</P>

<P>Why do people make them, what are they for, what
kind of future world would support this device?
Try to suggest some convincing answers &ndash; answers
that can snow real live venture capitalists!</P>

<P>And it's a toy. That's of vital importance.
The target is the age 9-12 demographic.
It's not for war, terror, prison, or home security,
tasty though those sinister applications may be.
We want parents buying this. It needs to
jump right off the shelf and into their loving arms.</P>

<P>Instructions need to be understandable by the
average 10-year-old. Parents will appropriate
disclaimers and assembly guides.</P>

<P>Entries might plausibly include:</P>


<P><ul><li>
Postindustrial biomaterials
</li>
<li>
Postindustrial assembly methods
</li>
<li>
<span class="p">Name of the pet</span>
</li>
<li>
Price point
</li>
<li>
Functions
</li>
<li>
Instructions for use
</li>
<li>
Safety and User Warnings
</li>
<li>
Who makes it and why
</li>
<li>
Adorable Xmas-season Viridian fake dog ads
</li></ul></P>

<P>And don't forget the exquisite ecological awareness!
We are looking for a child-friendly guide-dog
to a <STRONG>greener</STRONG> biofuture, with biosensors, industrial
biotech, the reduced ecological footprint of a new
bioeconomy, bioenergy sources, and so forth.</P>

<P>Although I am not going, I'm paid nothing, and I'm not
judging this contest, I do have some briefing papers for
the upcoming GBN event here. These suggestive excerpts may
help nudge you into the proper design space.
Bioelectronics, biomaterials, enzymatic engineering,
agrobiotech, environmental bioremediation, and strange
things to do with tissuelike substances: these are the
topics your Contest Judges will be studying at their event
this October. Present this in appropriate lingo, get under
their imaginative skin, and you, Viridian Designer,
are gonna be walkin' the robot dog.</P>

<P>This contest ends September 30, 2002.</P>

<h3>BIOELECTRONICS</h3>

<P>By integrating chemical and physical
devices such as silicon chips,
cantilevers, and carbon-based structures,
we can control the nanoscale patterning
of hybrid electronic devices... Antibodies
that adhere to metal can create biological
molds and patterns for electronic devices...
Organic electroluminescent displays and
chemical sensors... The inherent
smallness and precise interactions of
biological molecules can dramatically
reduce the size of circuit patterns...</P>

<H3>BIOMATERIALS</h3>

<P>Naturally-evolved materials for engineered,
intentional applications... ultra-strong,
light-weight, such as spider silks
synthesized in bacterial cells</P>

<h3>ENZYMATIC ENGINEERING</h3>

<P>Replace industrial manufacturing with
room-temperature enzymatic sustainable
processes. No acids, phosphorous, or
hazardous metal wastes... enzymes
have evolved to catalyze chemical
reactions at blood heat while the
typical industrial equivalent might
require several thousand degrees Centigrade.
Enzymes such as lipases, proteases,
cullulases and amylases are substituted
for noxious high-energy industrial chemistry.
Environmentally friendly, highly efficient
and cost-effective.</P>

<h3>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY</h3>

<P>Crops reengineered for greater ranges
of environmental conditions, temperature
and moisture extremes... Molecular tuning
of oils, fats, proteins and carbohydrates,
alterations in leaf, petal, stem, branch,
root and seed structure, modified
breeding and growth cycles.</P>

<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION</h3>

<P>Oil spills, contaminated soil, water and air, arising
from the unregulated use of of technologies
since the Industrial Revolution... Microbial
cleaner-organisms for industrial effluent,
groundwater, petrochemicals... A genetically
engineered microbe consumes target waste
over a discrete time window, then dies...</P>

<h3>TISSUE ENGINEERING</h3>

<P>Focused on the construction of
new tissues and organs as replacement
parts for diseased and aging body parts.
Using the skill and knowledge of cell
biologists, molecular biologists,
biomaterial engineers and CAD designers,
tissue engineers have set out to grow
liver, bone, muscle, cartilage, heart
muscles and pancreatic tissues.</P>
