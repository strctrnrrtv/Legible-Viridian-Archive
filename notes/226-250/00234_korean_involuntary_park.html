(((The useful concept of a "Viridian Involuntary Park"
is a long-term favorite of ours.  I could explain
this notion all over again, but why?  We just installed
Google on our Viridian website!  Go do a search there, and
read all about these areas of the planet that have
been abandoned to wilderness against the will of
the human race.)))</P>

"DMZ poised to emerge as precious ecotourist destination</P>

<P>"In the wake of the recent reconciliatory mood between
South and North Korea, Seoul is taking various measures to
preserve the valuable nature in the Demilitarized Zone
(DMZ) that bisects the Korean Peninsula.</P>

<P>"According to the South Korean government's six-year study
of the ecosystem in the DMZ, the 250-km-long, 4-km-wide
no-man's land that separates heavily armed forces has been
reconfirmed as housing some of the world's rarest species
of flora and fauna.</P>

<P>"Revealing its study conducted from 1995 until Feb. 6 of
last year, the Korea Forest Research Institute (...)
discovered about 100 rare, endangered and unrecorded
species of plants, animals and microorganisms living in
the 90,803 hectares of land that separate the two Koreas.
Existing as a buffer zone between the two Koreas for half
a century has enriched the DMZ's ecosystem. (((Mostly this
is through the useful fact that anybody walking around in
the DMZ will be shot.)))</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"The rare species include eagles, antelope, cranes, frogs
and roe deer, or as zoological purists would have them,
Aegypius, Nemorhaedus caudatus, Grus japonensis, Rona
plancyi chonsenica and Moschus moschiferus, respectively.</P>

<P>"Also found in the DMZ were rare and previously unknown
species of flora with the botanical names of Hanabusaya
Asiatica, Echinosophora Koreensis, Iris setosa, Epilobium
Angustifolium and Iris Dichotoma.  (...)</P>

<P>"The Seoul government is pushing ahead with a project to
register part of the DMZ with the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
as a Transboundary Biosphere Reserve (TBR).</P>

<P>"UNESCO has so far designated five TBRs: Tatra National
Park (between Poland and Slovakia), the Danube Delta
(Romania and Ukraine), Krkonose National Park (the Czech
Republic, Poland), Vosges Du Nord Park (France and
Germany) and East Carpathians Natural Park (Poland,
Slovakia, Ukraine). (((What's with that Polish thing?)))</P>

<P>"'We see no reason for North Korea to object to the
registration of the DMZ as a UNESCO TBR which allows both
South and North Korea to get financial and technical
assistance from the world body for the preservation and
sustained development of the buffer zone and its
vicinities,' said Shim Soo-kyong of the Korean branch of
the UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB), which is in charge of
reviewing applications and registration of TBRs.  (...)</P>

<P>"(The) initiative came amid concerns that construction of
the inter-Korean railroad and highway through the western
part of the DMZ would eventually devastate the natural
ecosystem preserved for the past half century. (((Oh yeah.
Yep.  No sooner does the sniping stop, than...)))</P>

<P>"Meanwhile, South and North Korea have agreed to refrain
from setting fire to trees and bushes within the DMZ, as
part of their efforts to preserve the environment there,
the Defense Ministry said on Feb. 9.   South and North
Korean militaries have adopted the practice of setting
fire to trees and bushes for surveillance purposes within
the DMZ.</P>

<P>"The military said there were 19 major fires within the
DMZ in 2000, which burned 371 square kilometers of land
and effectively detonated 703 landmines buried there."</P>

<P>NEW YORK OPEN CENTER
SATURDAY MARCH 24, 2001 7:30 PM
83 Spring Street, New York  $12*
Registration: 212 219 2527
SPACE IS LIMITED!!</P>

<P>Join ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE, INDYMEDIA, GEEKCORPS and many
other 'Cyber Greens'  for a lively evening of discussion,
networking and strategy for harnessing new digital media
tools and the Internet to build a sustainable future.</P>

<P>Focussed on activism and independent media, topics will
range from new networking and web-based campaign
strategies to click-actions; hacktivism to funding issues,
as well as a discussion about the possibilities and
challenges ahead in the 'post-dot.com' world.</P>

<P>PLANETWORK is a California-based, international,
interdisciplinary "link-tank" for Cyber Greens, dedicated
to providing forums for innovators from a wide range of
backgrounds to share their visions of how the Internet and
global information technology might help adaptively
transform human culture and activate awareness  of both
environmental problems and their solutions.  (((Yeah
brother!  Hoohah!)))</P>

<P>In May 2000, PLANETWORK convened a large-scale conference
in San Francisco that gathered over 700 people from a wide
spectrum of fields, from information technology and green
e-commerce, to ecology and biology, the arts, new media
and education and environmental activism.</P>
