<P>(((How interesting to see that George W. Bush's very first
broken campaign promise is about regulating carbon
dioxide.  Mind you, this move is not catastrophic.
Personally, I find it difficult to countenance
classifying carbon dioxide as a "pollutant". Carbon
dioxide is the nontoxic,  one-hundred-percent natural
product of the living exhalations of blue whales, pandas,
and seal pups. Those aren't "polluting" entities.</P>

<P>(((The planet's biosphere can't survive without <STRONG>some</STRONG>
carbon dioxide: our problem is there's way too much of it,
way too fast.  Classifying CO2 as a "pollutant" was a
bureaucratic maneuver to allow the American EPA to further
its regulatory reach.  With coal, that's not even much
needed, since coal spews many awful megatons of <STRONG>actual</STRONG>
pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and mercury.</P>

<P>(((Nevertheless, the denial freaks are in no doubt
whatever that this development ranks as a major victory
for them and their lobbying efforts.  That's true.  George
W. Bush reneged on his word.  He (and especially the
formerly chain-smoking Dick Cheney) have sold the country
out to a fatcat cabal of  polluters.  It's shameful.</P>

<P>(((Never mind all that just now, though == the Bush
dynasty has a longtime problem with that broken-promise
thing, and we'll be seeing little political rills of blood
from this banderilla for quite a while.  Instead, let's
get right in the trenches of right-wing Washington and see
how they did it, and who they blame and credit. It's
especially fun to check out their future goals and
tactics.)))</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"Dear Cooler Heads and colleagues,</P>

<P>"President Bush and Vice President Cheney have made the
right decision on regulating CO2 with a little good advice
from their friends.  We have won a famous victory, and
everyone should congratulate themselves on the work they
did to achieve this end.  I encourage all of you to send
out press statements congratulating Bush.  (This, after
all, could be a turning point in the war to save
industrial civilization from itself.)"</P>

<P>(((If you ever wondered if right-wing conservatives were
just as flaky as the weirdest New Age hippies, that last
sentence should bring you around.  That is the brassy,
ringing sound of true lunacy.)))</P>


<P>"A special huzzah to former-Rep. David McIntosh and Marlo
Lewis (chairman-emeritus of the Cooler Heads Coalition and
now with Reason PPI) for initiating the EIA study that
gave the administration the cover they needed to get out
of the dead end they had blundered into.  Our allies in
Congress did a lot of heavy lifting to get this done
without a lot of splitting the difference and waffling."
(((The Cooler Heads Coalition lives in terror of moderate
Republicans in Congress.)))</P>

<P>"Although we have won Round Two, Round Three has already
started and we are losing.  Round Three is about staffing
the key global warming and Kyoto policy positions in the
administration.  Annie Pesonk of the Environmental Defense
Fund has apparently been appointed to a dual position at
CEQ or OSTP and the National Security Council to co-
ordinate Kyoto policy.</P>

<P>((("Annie Pesonk" == never heard of her, but I hope she's
wearing Kevlar.)))</P>

<P>"While grassroots opposition denied John Turner the
appointment as deputy secretary of Interior, he is now
apparently the front-runner for assistant secretary of
State for oceans and international agreements.  And
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill has urged President Bush
in a memo to have Michael Oppenheimer of Environmental
Defense Fund put in charge of briefing the president on
global warming science.</P>

<P>"O'Neill has recommended other global warming true
believers connected to the Heinz Center (he, Fred Krupp,
and Ken Lay are on the board).</P>

<P>((("Ken Lay" would be Kenneth Lay of Enron Corporation.
Since Kenneth Lay sells natural gas and is the number-one
George W. financial and political supporter, coal people
hate and fear him.  They're both in fossil fuels, but that
doesn't make them pals.)))</P>

<P>"So we have a lot of work to do.  I urge all of you take a
simple message to your contacts in the Bush-Cheney
Administration: everyone appointed to a key job should be
fully on board with the president's opposition to Kyoto
and to regulating carbon dioxide.</P>

<P>(((This means purging Christie Whitman and Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill.  Kind of a Greenhouse Night of the
Long Knives thing.  Get ready for a constant drumbeat of
anti-Clinton-style leaks and allegations.)))</P>

<P>"We should go back and re-visit the assistant
administrator for air quality at EPA, where reportedly
Whitman's litmus test question required that candidates be
enthusiastically in favor of regulating CO2.</P>

<P>"The text of Bush's letter follows.  Please note that
while the Washington Post, New York Times, Financial
Times, etc. put the story on the front page and it was on
the networks last night, the Washington Times led with the
Army beret story and ran the CO2 story on the business
page. (((The Moonie-supported Washington Times is such a
whore that Myron actually aspires to place his "news"
articles on desired pages.)))</P>

<P>"Congratulations and many thanks,
Myron."</P>

Presidential letter.)))</P>

<P>"THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary
For Immediate Release March 13, 2001
TEXT OF A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT
TO SENATORS HAGEL, HELMS, CRAIG, AND
ROBERTS
"Thank you for your letter of March 6, 2001, asking for
the Administration's views on global climate change, in
particular the Kyoto Protocol and efforts to regulate
carbon dioxide under the Clean Air Act.</P>

<P>"My Administration takes the issue of global climate
change very seriously. As you know, I oppose the Kyoto
Protocol because it exempts 80 percent of the world,
including major population centers such as China and
India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to
the U.S. economy. The Senate's vote, 95-0, shows that
there is a clear consensus that the Kyoto Protocol is an
unfair and ineffective means of addressing global climate
change concerns.</P>

<P>"As you also know, I support a comprehensive and balanced
national energy policy that takes into account the
importance of improving air quality.</P>

<P>"Consistent with this balanced approach, I intend to work
with the Congress on a multipollutant strategy to require
power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide,
nitrogen oxides, and mercury. Any such strategy would
include phasing in reductions over a reasonable period of
time, providing regulatory certainty, and offering market-
based incentives to help industry meet the targets. I do
not believe, however, that the government should impose on
power plants mandatory emissions reductions for carbon
dioxide, which is not a 'pollutant' under the Clean Air
Act.</P>

<P>"A recently released Department of Energy Report,
'Analysis of Strategies for Reducing Multiple Emissions
from Power Plants,' concluded that including caps on
carbon dioxide emissions as part of a multiple emissions
strategy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from
coal to natural gas for electric power generation and
significantly higher electricity prices compared to
scenarios in which only sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides
were reduced.</P>

<P>"This is important new information that warrants a
reevaluation, especially at a time of rising energy prices
and a serious energy shortage. Coal generates more than
half of America's electricity supply. At a time when
California has already experienced energy shortages, and
other Western states are worried about price and
availability of energy this summer, we must be very
careful not to take actions that could harm consumers.
((("I'm choking you, but hey, I'm bribing you.")))</P>

<P>"This is especially true given the incomplete state of
scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to,
global climate change and the lack of commercially
available technologies for removing and storing carbon
dioxide."  (((A stellar triumph for denial obscurantism
here.)))</P>

<P>"Consistent with these concerns, we will continue to fully
examine global climate change issues == including the
science, technologies, market-based systems, and
innovative options for addressing concentrations of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. I am very optimistic
that, with the proper focus and working with our friends
and allies, we will be able to develop technologies,
market incentives, and other creative ways to address
global climate change.  (((I'm also plenty optimistic, but
not about our current President and Vice-President.
"Creativity" is anything but their strong-suit.)))</P>

<P>"I look forward to working with you and others to address
global climate change issues in the context of a national
energy policy that protects our environment, consumers,
and economy.
Sincerely,
GEORGE W. BUSH"</P>

<P>(((So who are these mysterious backroom entities that pull
the President's strings and are responsible for blackening
our skies and frying us?  Well, here they are. Simple as
that.)))</P>

never mind, Greening Earth will always have a sentimental
corner on Viridian resentment.)))</P>

<P>(((The truly funny part of this quite grim development is
in the other and much larger headlines of the past few
weeks.  The last time our planet underwent genuine,
serious cutbacks in our ever-rising CO2 emissions was
during the Great Depression.  Here the news looks
promising indeed.  The new Administration is well on the
way to a major, knee-buckling recession; in two or three
years, we may see SUVs sold off in joblots, while big
smoking factories close coast to coast.)))</P>
