<P>"A Tiger by the Tail</P>

<P>By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN</P>

<P>"And now for a wild prediction. Within 12 months President</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and all their backers in<BR>
the oil industry will be begging == begging == to revive<BR>
the Kyoto protocol on climate change, the accord Mr. Bush<BR>
yanked America out of after taking office."<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>((("Begging"?  No way!  They might, however, cover Tom
Daschle's South  Dakota in windmills.  Their best tactic
at this point is to go private-sector green, and *greener
than Kyoto,* which, given Kyoto's pathetic treaty targets,
would not really be that hard.  An American wind boom
would be  faster and cheaper than Cheney's energy policy.
Even Enron, the ultimate Bush energy company, has an Enron</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Wind arm.  Most every company that's serious about energy<BR>
has hedged their Kyoto bets with some green power ==<BR>
except for ExxonMobil, that is.)))<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, you ask? Well, look what's happening in England.
A group of celebrities there have joined with
environmentalists to launch a  boycott against Exxon Mobil
gas stations, which in Europe go by the  name Esso. Bianca
Jagger, the pop star Annie Lennox and Anita  Rodrick,
founder of the Body Shop chain, helped launch the boycott
because, as Ms. Jagger said, 'This is a way to tell Esso
that it's  not right for them to be claiming that there is
no connection between  CO2 emissions and climate change.'"</P>

<P>(((So Europeans have finally had the good sense to beat up
Americans rather than BP and Shell, the Viridian darlings
among oil titans.  The problem is that these pop-stars
just want their Kyoto back.  That's not good enough.
These clowns at Exxon have blundered massively.  No
company that reckless and stupid should be allowed to
survive.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People connected with Exxon reportedly contributed
more than $1  million to the Bush campaign. (((Yep!)))
Exxon is a key supporter of research  and advertisements
that try to cast doubt on the seriousness of  global
warming and its link to fossil fuel emissions.  (((They
bet the farm on denial politics.)))  Exxon was a big
backer of President Bush's decision to pull the U.S. out
of the 1997  Kyoto Protocol, which called for
industrialized nations to steadily  reduce their carbon
dioxide emissions. (((That's the smoking gun that has
finally made ExxonMobil the public face of global
warming.)))  Exxon is also a major force  behind the
Global Climate Coalition, a business lobby that opposed
Kyoto.  (((Here is where it gets personal for us
Viridians.  That's the GCC, folks, the world's biggest
whirlwind of black climate spin.  Everything  that
breathes will be much better off when the GCC ceases to
be.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 'Stop Esso Campaign' is asking British drivers to
shun Esso  stations until the company supports Kyoto (see
<A HREF="http://www.stopesso.com/">www.stopesso.com</A>). The  campaign recently spread to
France.   (((Naturally we should all "shun Esso," but
boycotts are not Viridian.  This is because they flunk the
"Viridian Grandfather Principle," in that your dead
grandfather is even better at boycotting Esso than you
are, because he's dead.  The Viridian version of this
activity is to boycott Exxon and <STRONG>buy from Shell and BP.</STRONG>
This tactic increases the disparity between Exxon and its
market competition.  This is rather likelier to lead to
Exxon's stock tanking and the well-deserved firing of
current Exxon CEO Lee R. Raymond.  Whereas the Stop Esso
campaign merely wants Exxon to recant its heresy.  Big
deal.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's funny is that probably none of this would have
happened had Mr. Bush not bowed to the oil  companies and
pulled the U.S. out of Kyoto. That  may turn out to be
his greatest gift to environmentalism.  (((Oh, I'm sure he
can come up with even greater gifts.  Another Three Mile
Island, for instance.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, as long as everyone was discussing how to
implement Kyoto,  no one wanted to take any radical steps.
(((Exactly.)))  Governments could say they  were working</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>on the problem, but that negotiations were hard. (((That<BR>
is <STRONG>why</STRONG> European politicos hate Bush now ==  because he<BR>
stole their political figleaf.))) Corporations could<BR>
mumble nice words about environmentalism, but not  worry<BR>
anything serious was going to happen.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Something serious <STRONG>is</STRONG> going to happen.  What 
might
this mean for you, if you work for Exxon nowadays?  Well,
whenever people are choking on  smoke and bailing
seawater, they're gonna pick on <STRONG>you.</STRONG>   Show some common
sense and get the hell away from this doomed enterprise.
It doesn't matter that they've got deep pockets and they
own the government this season; they're gonna end up
indicted just like those goons at Elf-Aquitaine.  Go work
for Shell.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And environmentalists  could feel their cause was
being advanced, even though implementation  was far off.
(((The grand Green delusion; it's better to feel good than
to get results.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'As long as Kyoto was there, everyone could avoid
real accountability  and pretend that something was
happening,' says Paul Gilding, the  former head of
Greenpeace and now chairman of Ecos, one of  Australia's
leading environmental consulting firms. 'But now George
Bush, by trashing Kyoto, has blown everyone's cover. If
you care  about the environment you can't pretend anymore.
Emissions are  increasing, the climate is changing and
people can now see for  themselves that the world is
fiddling while Rome burns.'  (((Not only can they see Rome
burning, but now they know who to indict as the burning
spreads out of control.   National governments can't very
well indict themselves.  But a hated, bankrupt company
once called ExxonMobil?   How are they gonna hire lawyers?
Where are they gonna hide?)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result: Environmentalists refuse to sit on their
hands anymore. Instead, the smart ones are mobilizing</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>consumers to fight  multinational polluters on their own<BR>
ground. You have to admire it.  It's so Republican ==<BR>
using the free market.  (((Tom, if it were Republican, it<BR>
wouldn't be done to American multinationals by angry<BR>
Europeans.)))<BR>
<BR>
"If I were Exxon, I would be worried == especially<BR>
when U.S. college students come back to campus in the<BR>
fall. Remember Monsanto?  (((Why yes we do, actually.  How<BR>
kind of you to bring them up.))) It was  going to sell<BR>
genetically modified food to Europeans. But<BR>
environmentalists in Europe == worried, rightly or<BR>
wrongly, about the  safety of what they were eating ==<BR>
mobilized the weakest link in the value chain: consumers.<BR>
Consumers demanded 'G.M.O.-free' food. So  supermarkets<BR>
demanded it from their suppliers, suppliers demanded it<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>from farmers and farmers demanded it from Monsanto.
Goodbye, Monsanto.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is real globalization activism. 'The smart</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>activists are now saying, "O.K., You want to play markets<BR>
== let's play," ' says Mr. Gilding. They don't waste time<BR>
throwing stones or lobbying  governments.  (((Actually,<BR>
they <STRONG>do</STRONG> throw stones, they <STRONG>do</STRONG> lobby governments, 
<STRONG>and</STRONG><BR>
they play markets, but Friedman would prefer them to knock<BR>
it off with one and two,  which are unseemly, and<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>concentrate on three, which he knows how to cover as a
journalist.)))  That takes forever and can easily be
counter-lobbied by  corporations.  (((Once they get the</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>hang of it,  oil corporations do a lot more than just<BR>
"counter-lobby" == they buy political parties outright,<BR>
like Elf-Aquitaine did in France and Germany even before<BR>
Exxon did it in the USA.)))   No, no, no. They start with<BR>
consumers at the pump, get  them to pressure the gas<BR>
stations, get the station owners to pressure  the<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>companies and the companies to pressure governments.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Gee, that tactic might work, Tom!   You might, for
instance,  walk into an Exxon gas station, and ask the
clerk "Had any serious trouble here yet?  Indictments,
lawsuits, people throwing rocks, any of that stuff?"  When
she says "No," act all surprised.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After all,  consumers do have choices where they buy
their gas, and there are  differences now. Shell and BP-
Amoco (which is also the world's biggest solar company)
both withdrew from the oil industry lobby that has been
dismissing climate change.  ((("BP-ExxonMobil" has got  a
nice ring to it; somebody's gotta buy up all of Exxon's
dead hardware at the global garage sale.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What Mr. Bush did in trashing Kyoto was to leave
serious environmental activists with nowhere else to turn
but the market.  (((And the war-crimes courts, but that's</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>a couple decades on.)))  The  smart ones get it. You will<BR>
be hearing from them soon == at a gas  station near you."<BR></P>
