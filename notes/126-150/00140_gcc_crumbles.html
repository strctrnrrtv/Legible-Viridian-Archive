"Texaco quits anti-Kyoto climate change group
<P>
"By Andrew Kelly
<P>
"HOUSTON, Feb 29 (Reuters) == In the first such defection
by a major U.S. oil company, Texaco Inc. said Tuesday it
was leaving the Global Climate Coalition, a business group
which opposes the Kyoto treaty's approach to fighting
global warming.  (...)
<P>
<P>
"Texaco's exit follows hard on the heels of auto
giants Ford Motor Co. and Daimler Chrysler AG which also
recently quit the group but said they remained opposed to
the mandatory curbs in greenhouse gas emissions set out in
the Kyoto treaty.
<P>
<P>
"Among other major oil companies, the European-based
Royal Dutch/Shell Group and BP Amoco  left the group in
1997 and 1998 respectively.
<P>
<P>
"Environmentalists have hailed the latest round of
defections, even though the companies say they remain
opposed to Kyoto.
<P>
<P>
"'It seems like lying about global warming has
finally fallen out of fashion in corporate America,' said
Christopher Ball of the Ozone Action group in Washington
D.C."
<P>
<P>
(((Great soundbite there, Christopher, but Greenhouse
denial will almost surely be as long-lived as Holocaust
denial.  Consider the 140-year-long denial of the
scientific facts of evolution.  These latter two denial
operations are  thriving enterprises today, and unlike the
GCC, they don't even enjoy lavish corporate funding.  Even
if Washington DC is directly washed away on live TV by
some Greenhouse cataclysm, there won't be any lack of
climate cranks eager to blame it all on lesbians.)))
<P>
<P>
"Ball said companies which remain members, such as
Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp. and General Motors Corp.
would face growing public pressure to stop funding the
group." (((Yes.   See <A HREF="http://www.campaignexxonmobil.org">http://www.campaignexxonmobil.org</A>,
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, Common Cause,
<A HREF="http://www.heatisonline.org/disinformation.cfm">http://www.heatisonline.org/disinformation.cfm</A> == a lot of work
there, but none of these orgs possess the $6 million a
year that the GCC has been dropping on American domestic
campaigns and denial agitpropaganda.)))
<P>
<P>
"Frank Maisano, spokesman for the Global Climate
Coalition, said it was ironic that companies were leaving
the group while continuing to voice support for its goals
but said the coalition would remain strong and viable.
<P>
<P>
"'We still have the same messages when it comes to
the Kyoto protocol. We still have the same messages when
it comes to the solutions for dealing with climate
change,' he said."
<P>
(((They still have "the same message" because they are a
one-trick pony. The GCC is a remarkably narrow, parochial
operation, whose heart beats firmly in the Heartland
Babbitry of the American Buchananite ultra-right.  The
only thing "global" about the GCC is the global climatic
havoc it has wreaked while pitchforking Kyoto regulators
away from the bottom lines of American coal companies.
As a pro-business NGO, the GCC is strictly a Beltway-based
operation; its only true victory has taken place inside
the Republican-dominated US Senate, where it forked over
enough cash to stymie debate on the Kyoto treaty.  Oil
companies, however, are genuinely multinational
enterprises. They are feeling the political Greenhouse
heat in their European constituencies, and besides, they
can read a thermometer and they are getting nervous.)))

"Dear Mr. Kelly,
<P>
<P>
"This is to inform you that we have decided not to
renew our membership in the Global Climate Coalition. For
the reasons set forth below, we believe that Texaco can
and should speak for itself or through broader-based
organizations on the important subject of climate change.
<P>
<P>
"As you know, Texaco shares society's concern over the
issue of climate change. As a global energy company
operating in over 150 countries, protection of the
environment must be among our core values. We understand
our responsibility to current and future generations to
conduct our business accordingly. (...)
<P>
<P>
"As a global company, however, we recognize that the
debate over climate change goes well beyond the matter of
the U.S. economy. We also believe that protracted debate
about the adequacy of the science is something Texaco
wishes to move beyond. Indeed, we believe the issue of
global climate  change is related to the broader question
about the best and most responsible environmental
behaviors we as a Company should maintain, consistent with
our values. These are questions we must consider with a
broader range of stakeholders.
<P>
<P>
"Texaco will continue to be involved in the effort
constantly to improve and broaden our environmental
stewardship.

(((My prediction for the future of the GCC is
threefold.   First, Kyoto will never pass a Republican
Senate, and Kyoto wouldn't solve the carbon crisis even if
it did pass, so the GCC might as well declare victory
there and move on to new ground.  The dirt-stained GCC
nameplate will be abandoned.  The operatives will move
into other, more sophisticated, better-financed operations
with similarly deceptive names.
<P>
<P>
(((There will be twofold pro-carbon activism:  first,
move into the fertile new realm of anti-WTO sentiment, and
tie the carbon issue firmly to American sovereignty:  "Who
voted for Kyoto?"  The second approach, however, is even
more ingenious:  simply suborn and bribe the UN's
environmental delegates in the way that they once did the
US Senate.  After all, the UN, like other multinational
bodies, is every bit as corrupt as the merely national
Senate is.  There's every reason for coal enthusiasts to
finally and truly go global, network with the major carbon
powers such as China and OPEC, seize the initiative by
putting real political money on the table, and write and
pass a new, Kyoto-style, global regulatory regime that
mandates the use of carbon worldwide.  Then they'll no
longer have to worry about market competition or the
looming threat of clean energy.   The carbon clique
already has enough cash to simply buy the debt-strapped
mess we have that passes for a world government.
Accomplish that, and they can live henceforth by pure
fiat.
<P>
<P>
(((Part three will be the carbon amnesty agitation,
after the global climate is demonstrably broken.  The
world will be a very different, and far uglier place then.
Some kind of accounting will take place, but that's by no
means the end of the story.  You'll hear every slick
excuse you heard in the Czech lustrations and the South
African Truth Commission trials.  It will come with the
full, practiced, loathsome, unctuous spin that has made
the GCC so notoriously vile that even oil companies can't
stand them.  Only instead of lurking in semi-stealth as
they do today,  they'll have to yell into the courthouse
microphones as the wind howls and the thunder flashes.)))
