Garry Peterson remarks:
<P>
(((Is  "conservation by pollution" a new trend?
<P>
(((Nature has blossomed in the "involuntary parks"
surrounding the Chernobyl reactors.  From the perspective
of mice or deer populations, dying young and having a high
rate of reproductive failure seem to be much better than
having people arround.
<P>
(((Perhaps the same is true now of whales.  In a bizarre
parody of the evolution of chemical defenses, whales can
now protect themselves from hunting by absorbing poison.
As long as they can still reproduce, whales may even be
better off.
<P>
(((It's like a non-intentional form of tree-spiking.  But
perhaps this is another way that conservationists could
protect the rhino and elephant: poison them.  Ensure that
they are radioactive or contaminated enough to discourage
poachers, but not so contaminated that they're sterile.)))

"The people of Japan, the world's main whaling nation, are
at last questioning the hunting of the leviathans after a
major food scare.
<P>
<P>
"After high levels of dangerous heavy metals and
chemicals were found in whalemeat, Japanese scientists
advised against eating it, so sales slumped. (...)
Research has shown that toxic chemicals can build up in
whales and dolphins to 70,000 times the levels found in
the waters in which they swim and feed, and can cause
serious human health problems, including damage to the
immune system, sterility, and 'gender-bender' hormone
disruptions.
<P>
<P>
"The development has is an extraordinary twist to one
of the oldest and most bitter environmental battles.
(...)  Last year, two Japanese toxicologists and two
geneticists from Harvard University analysed more than 100
samples of the meat bought in restaurants, shops and
markets across Japan, in a study co-ordinated by the
British-based Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and
the Swiss Coalition for the Protection of Whales.
<P>
<P>
"They were astonished at the results. About half of
all the samples proved to be contaminated with heavy
metals or dangerous chemicals including mercury, dioxins,
DDT and PCBs above the maximum levels allowed for human
consumption under Japanese and international standards.
<P>
<P>
"They also found that a quarter of the samples were
sold under false pretences, in fact containing meat from
other species such as dolphins and porpoises and, in one
case in 20, from fully protected species such as humpback
and sperm whales. More than three-quarters of these mis-
advertised products proved to be for human consumption.
<P>
<P>
"Japan's Fisheries Agency insisted then that whalemeat
sold to consumers was not seriously contaminated. But in
November, a separate study by the country's official
Environment Agency confirmed that whales and dolphins were
highly polluted.
<P>
<P>
"Further research suggested, in the words of one
scientist, that eating just three ounces of dolphin meat
or one ounce of liver 'would cause significant health
problems.'"

Alan Wexelblat remarks:
<P>
(((This is weird enough to qualify as a Viridian Disaster
of the "uncanny" variety.  Bizarre basketball-sized ice is
falling on Spain, origin unknown.)))
<P>
(((Bruce Sterling remarks: it's a pity it didn't fall on
the Washington headquarters of the Global Climate
Coalition.  We can always hope. I must say I do enjoy
these news clippings that have the look-and-feel of a
cheap SF novel about "The Year 2000 AD.")))

"MADRID, Spain == Are they giant hail stones? Comet
debris? Frozen airliner sewage?  Scientists are hoping
chemical analysis will clear up the origin of some 15
basketball-sized chunks of ice that have fallen from the
sky in southern Spain over the past 10 days.
<P>
<P>
"No one has been injured so far, but one iceball
smashed into a frozen car near Seville. Two others damaged
rooftops elsewhere in Spain.
<P>
<P>
"So far, experts have come up cold in their search
for an explanation.
<P>
<P>
"'The most surprised person of all by this
phenomenon is me,' said geologist Jesus Martinez Frias,
who is heading a team of Spanish scientists that has
traveled over the country collecting and analyzing the
blocks of ice, which weigh as much as 8 pounds. (...)
<P>
<P>
"Martinez said the balls should have been large
enough while plummeting through the atmosphere to register
on radar screens."
