(((It's really fun to watch the infowar struggle between
the Greenhouse denial industry and people in touch with
reality.  As social struggles for social credibility go,
it's very much like tobacco and cancer.  "Everybody does
it, "no such thing," "doctors smoke it," "you can't prove
it," "maybe it exists but it wasn't us," violent defense
of extensive government subsidies, lots of hired guns in
courts and Congress, and, eventually, a move of the
industry offshore, out of immediate reach of public
indignation.  The Greenhouse denial industry has learned a
lot by the experience of tobacco and nuclear. In a New
Gilded Age of government-for-sale, they have so much soft
money that they can spread the wealth by advertising in
each other's fanzines.
<P>
(((Those who don't believe that there is a thriving denial
"industry" should subscribe immediately to "Environment
and Climate News: The Monthly Newspaper for New-Era
Environmentalists."  <A HREF="http://www.heartland.org">http://www.heartland.org</A>
<P>
(((It's published by the Heartland Institute, a Chicago-
based crank-wing think-tank.  It's lavishly financed by
those paragons of iniquity, the Greening Earth Society aka
Western Fuels Association (Fredrick D. Palmer is the
president of both organizations.)    A truly marvelous
publication whose every page makes rivetting reading,
ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE NEWS is violently and reflexively
wrong on every conceivable quasi-environmental issue:
genetics, national parks, WTO, FDA, EPA, urban zoning,
plant safety inspections, you can name it.
<P>
(((The coollest part of the reading experience is watching
'em all come out of the woodwork in fellow-traveller
solidarity. Heartland Institute, Greening Earth Society,
Western Fuels, Lexington Institute, Cato Institute,
junkscience.com, People for the USA, Buckeye Institute for
Public Policy Solutions, Competitive Enterprise Institute,
National Center for Policy Analysis, and a nice, juicy,
supportive ad from the National Association of
Manufacturers.  It would have taken a lot of honest
journalistic work to compile an enemies' list like that.
Why bother, when you can get it every month for free, plus
a two-page list of their press contacts?  I'm seriously
contemplating taking out a small but useful Viridian ad in
ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE NEWS.  After all, we're "new-era
environmentalists" if anybody is.
<P>
(((In the meantime, all marginalized and discredited, we
climate alarmists are left with meager moral support from
the President of the United States and a Swiss convention
of the world's richest people.)))

"The greatest environmental challenge of the new century
is global warming. Scientists tell us that the 1990s were
the hottest decade of the entire millennium. If we fail to
reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves
and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will
be flooded, economies disrupted.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Many people in the United States and around the world
</BLOCKQUOTE>
still believe we can't cut greenhouse gas pollution
without slowing economic growth. In the Industrial Age
that may have been true. In the digital economy, it isn't.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "New technologies make it possible to cut harmful
</BLOCKQUOTE>
emissions and provide even more growth. For example, just
last week, automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80
miles a gallon == the fruits of a unique research
partnership between government and industry. Before you
know it, efficient production of biofuels will give us the
equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gas.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "To speed innovations in environmental technologies, I
</BLOCKQUOTE>
propose giving major tax incentives to businesses for the
production of clean energy == and to families for buying
energy-saving homes and appliances and the next generation
of super-efficient cars when they hit the showroom floor.
I also call on the auto industry to use available
technologies to make all new cars more fuel efficient
right away. And on Congress to make more of our clean-
energy technologies available to the developing world ==
creating cleaner growth abroad and new jobs at home."

"Business leaders say climate change is our greatest
challenge
<P>
"Davos, Switzerland, 27 January 2000 == The greatest
challenge facing the world at the beginning of the
century, according to hundreds of business and government
leaders at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in
Davos, is climate change.  The surprise verdict was
reached after five of the world's leading thinkers
presented their visions for the future and the
participants voted electronically on their scenarios.  An
end to traditional ethics and an ineffective international
system came in second and third."
