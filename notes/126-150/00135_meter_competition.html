DESIGN COMPETITION ANNOUNCEMENT

<P>
<BR>
The Sustainability Institute
<P>
in cooperation with
<P>
The International Network of Resource Information Centers
(aka the Balaton Group)
<P>
announces
<P>
<BR>
THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL<BR>
VIRIDIAN DESIGN COMPETITION
<P>
<BR>
A Total of $8000 USD in Prizes
<P>
will be awarded for excellence
in the design of a functional and aesthetically dazzling
<P>
VIRIDIAN ELECTRICITY METER
<P>
<BR>
The Viridian Electricity Meter is a household energy
consumption meter that resides in a prominent place inside
the home.  Its purpose is to provide accurate, compelling,
and artistically fascinating feedback to homeowners  about
their current energy use.  Users are rewarded
aesthetically for reducing energy consumption (and for
switching their energy source to a renewable one).  In
other words, the more sustainable their energy
consumption, the more beautiful and fascinating the
meters' display.
<P>
Viridian Meters should be technically accurate,
artistically creative, adaptable to many different
cultural contexts, marketable, and above all, very, very
cool.  Commercially produced Viridian Meters should be
capable of generating consumer desire.  The ideal Viridian
Electricity Meter would be so attractive, people would
simply want one, regardless of whether they personally
cared very much about saving energy.
<P>
Design specifications and submission instructions (below)
should be followed carefully.  Background on the Viridian
design movement follows.
<P>
Background on The Viridian Movement and the Viridian Meter
<P>
The term viridian == a word referring to a bluish shade of
green -- was  adopted by U.S. science fiction author Bruce
Sterling as the name for the design movement he initiated
in 1999, and launched formally with a Manifesto on January
3, 2000.  The intent of the Viridian Movement is to
stimulate the reinvention of everyday products and
technologies in the industrial world, so that they are
both environmentally benign and aesthetically superior to
products now in use.  (To read more about the Viridian
Movement, visit its website:  <A HREF="http://www.bespoke.org/viridian">www.bespoke.org/viridian</A>)
<P>
The concept of the Viridian Electricity Meter originated
with Stefan Jones, a member of the Viridian Curia (an
international core group of designers and writers, linked
by internet). The Meter began, like most Viridian ideas,
as an imaginary product, for which Bruce Sterling wrote
the following imaginary advertisement:
<P>
"One of the most offensive artifacts of the  twentieth
century is the standard household energy meter.   This
ugly gizmo clings like a barnacle to the outside of  your
home, readable only by functionaries.  Clumsily  painted
in battleship gray, this network spy device  features
creepy, illegible little clock-dials, under an ungainly
glass dome.  Look  a bit closer, and this user- hostile
interface deliberately insults you, with a hateful  anti-
theft warning, and a foul little lockbox.
<P>
"This crass device is  designed to leave you in  stellar
ignorance of your own energy usage.  It publicly brands
you as a helpless peon, a technically-illiterate source of
cash for remote, uncaring utility lords.
<P>
"But today, thanks to the Viridian Electrical  Meter, the
tables are turned.  The Viridian Meter is not  some
utility spy device, but a user-owned art object!"
<P>
The purpose of the competition is to bring forward as many
different design ideas for the Viridian Meter as possible,
to increase the likelihood of discovering one or more
ideas with the potential for being manufactured and
distributed in the mass market.
<P>
The competition sponsors therefore encourage maximum
design creativity and diversity in reinterpreting the
Viridian Meter concept, together with technical accuracy,
functional utility, and consumer ease-of-use.
<P>
Procedure for Submissions
<P>
The Competition will proceed in two rounds.  In the first
round, entering teams or individuals will submit a one-
page written description of their proposed Meter, a one-
page description of the individual or team submitting the
design, and (optional) a one-page artist's conceptual
drawing or technical schematic drawing of the proposed
Meter.  The written description should be clear, colorful,
and compelling, while also conveying the following key
facts:
<P>
O=c=O Visual appearance of the meter
O=c=O Manner in which information on energy consumption
will be displayed<BR>
O=c=O Basic technical description of how energy usage will
be monitored<BR>
O=c=O Intended position within a residence (e.g., wall-
mounted, table-top, etc.)<BR>
O=c=O Materials and components to be used in construction
<P>
Participants should also indicate whether they are able to
construct a working prototype of their design.
<P>
In the second round, up to fifteen Finalists will be
invited to submit a more detailed schematic proposal and,
if feasible, a working prototype.
<P>
The competition judges will then select anywhere from one
to eight winners, depending on the quality of the
submissions, and divide the prize money as they see fit.
<P>
Winners will have their work featured on a competition web
site, and their designs may be introduced to potential
manufacturers and retailers.  Features  articles about the
competition will be written and submitted to leading art
and design magazines.  Entrants will retain all rights to
their designs, but Finalists will sign agreements allowing
the Sustainability Institute to reproduce images of their
submissions.

Submissions on paper should be sent to:
