"MELTING OF EARTH'S ICE COVER REACHES NEW HIGH
by Lisa Mastny
<P>
"The Earth's ice cover is melting in more places and at
higher rates than at any time since record keeping began.
Reports from around the world compiled by the Worldwatch
Institute (see data table below) show that global ice
melting accelerated during the 1990s == which was also the
warmest decade on record. (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The Arctic sea ice, covering an area roughly the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
size of the United States, shrunk by an estimated 6
percent between 1978 and 1996, losing an average of 34,300
square kilometers == an area larger than the Netherlands
== each year.
<P>
"The Arctic sea ice has also thinned dramatically
since the 1960s and 70s. Between this period and the mid-
1990s, the average thickness dropped from 3.1 meters to
1.8 meters == a decline of nearly 40 percent in less than
30 years. (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The massive Antarctic ice cover, which averages 2.3
</BLOCKQUOTE>
kilometers in thickness and represents some 91 percent of
Earth's ice, is also melting. So far, most of the loss has
occurred along the edges of the Antarctic Peninsula, on
the ice shelves that form when the land-based ice sheets
flow into the ocean and begin to float. Within the past
decade, three ice shelves have fully disintegrated: the
Wordie, the Larsen A, and the Prince Gustav. Two more, the
Larsen B and the Wilkins, are in full retreat and are
expected to break up soon, having lost more than one-
seventh of their combined 21,000 square kilometers since
late 1998 == a loss the size of Rhode Island. Icebergs as
big as Delaware have also broken off Antarctica in recent
years, posing threats to open-water shipping. (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Outside the poles, most ice melt has occurred in
</BLOCKQUOTE>
mountain and subpolar glaciers, which have responded much
more rapidly to temperature changes. (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "As mountain glaciers shrink, large regions that rely
</BLOCKQUOTE>
on glacial runoff for water supply could experience severe
shortages. The Quelccaya Ice Cap, the traditional water
source for Lima, Peru, is now retreating by some 30 meters
a year == up from only 3 meters a year before 1990 ==
posing a threat to the city's 10 million residents. And in
northern India, a region already facing severe water
scarcity, an estimated 500 million people depend on the
tributaries of the glacier-fed Indus and Ganges rivers for
irrigation and drinking water. But as the Himalayas melt,
these rivers are expected to initially swell and then fall
to dangerously low levels, particularly in summer. (In
1999, the Indus reached record high levels because of
glacial melt.)"

"TABLE 1:  SELECTED EXAMPLES OF ICE MELT AROUND THE WORLD
<P>
"Arctic Sea Ice<BR>
Arctic Ocean<BR>
Has shrunk by 6 percent since 1978, with a 14 percent loss
of thicker, year-round ice. Has thinned by 40 percent in
less than 30 years.
<P>
"Greenland Ice Sheet<BR>
Greenland<BR>
Has thinned by more than a meter a year on its southern
and eastern edges since 1993.
<P>
"Columbia Glacier<BR>
Alaska, United States<BR>
Has retreated nearly 13 kilometers since 1982. In 1999,
retreat rate increased from 25 meters per day to 35 meters
per day.
<P>
"Glacier National Park<BR>
Rocky Mtns., United States<BR>
Since 1850, the number of glaciers has dropped from 150 to
fewer than 50. Remaining glaciers could disappear
completely in 30 years.
<P>
"Antarctic Sea Ice<BR>
Southern Ocean<BR>
Ice to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula decreased by
some 20 percent between 1973 and 1993, and continues to
decline.
<P>
"Pine Island Glacier<BR>
West Antarctica<BR>
Grounding line (where glacier hits ocean and floats)
retreated 1.2 kilometers a year between 1992 and 1996. Ice
thinned at a rate of 3.5 meters per year.
<P>
"Larsen B Ice Shelf<BR>
Antarctic Peninsula<BR>
Calved a 200 km2 iceberg in early 1998. Lost an additional
1,714 km2 during the 1998-1999 season, and 300 km2 so far
during the 1999-2000 season.
<P>
"Tasman Glacier<BR>
New Zealand<BR>
Terminus has retreated 3 kilometers since 1971, and main
front has retreated 1.5 kilometers since 1982. Has thinned
by up to 200 meters on average since the 1971-82 period.
Icebergs began to break off in 1991, accelerating the
collapse.
<P>
"Meren, Carstenz, and Northwall Firn Glaciers
Irian Jaya, Indonesia<BR>
Rate of retreat increased to 45 meters a year in 1995, up
from only 30 meters a year in 1936. Glacial area shrank by
some 84 percent between 1936 and 1995. Meren Glacier is
now close to disappearing altogether.
<P>
"Dokriani Bamak Glacier<BR>
Himalayas, India<BR>
Retreated by 20 meters in 1998, compared with an average
retreat of 16.5 meters over the previous 5 years. Has
retreated a total of 805 meters since 1990.
<P>
"Duosuogang Peak<BR>
Ulan Ula Mtns., China<BR>
Glaciers have shrunk by some 60 percent since the early
1970s.
<P>
"Tien Shan Mountains<BR>
Central Asia<BR>
Twenty-two percent of glacial ice volume has disappeared
in the past 40 years.
<P>
"Caucasus Mountains<BR>
Russia<BR>
Glacial volume has declined by 50 percent in the past
century.
<P>
"Alps<BR>
Western Europe<BR>
Glacial area has shrunk by 35 to 40 percent and volume has
declined by more than 50 percent since 1850. Glaciers
could be reduced to only a small fraction of their present
mass within decades.
<P>
"Mt. Kenya<BR>
Kenya<BR>
Largest glacier has lost 92 percent of its mass since the
late 1800s.
<P>
"Speka Glacier<BR>
Uganda<BR>
Retreated by more than 150 meters between 1977 and 1990,
compared with only 35-45 meters between 1958 and 1977.
<P>
"Upsala Glacier<BR>
Argentina<BR>
Has retreated 60 meters a year on average over the last 60
years, and rate is accelerating.
<P>
"Quelccaya Glacier<BR>
Andes, Peru<BR>
Rate of retreat increased to 30 meters a year in the
1990s, up from only 3 meters a year between the 1970s and
1990.
