"Patent filed on energy discovery: UC Berkeley and
Colorado scientists find valuable new source of fuel"
<P>
By Kathleen Scalise, Public Affairs
<P>
<P>
"BERKELEY == A metabolic switch that triggers algae
to turn sunlight into large quantities of hydrogen gas, a
valuable fuel, is the subject of a new discovery reported
for the first time by University of California, Berkeley,
scientists and their Colorado colleagues. The news appears
in this month's issue of the journal 'Plant Physiology.'
<P>
<P>
"'I guess it's the equivalent of striking oil,' said
UC Berkeley plant and microbial biology professor Tasios
Melis.  'It was enormously exciting, it was unbelievable.'
<P>
(((Oh, I believe it all right.  What I wonder is: what
does it <strong>smell</strong> like?)))
<P>
<P>
"Melis and postdoctoral associate Liping Zhang of
UC Berkeley made the discovery == funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) Hydrogen Program == with Dr.
Michael Seibert, Dr. Maria Ghirardi and postdoctoral
associate Marc Forestier of the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado.
<P>
<P>
"Currently, hydrogen fuel is extracted from natural
gas, a non-renewable energy source. The new discovery
makes it possible to harness nature's own tool,
photosynthesis, to produce the promising alternative fuel
from sunlight and water. A joint patent on this new
technique for capturing solar energy has been taken out by
the two institutions.
<P>
(((Why is NREL patenting stuff?  If they really have
"struck hydrogen," it's gonna be interesting to watch the
subsequent money trail.)))
<P>
<P>
"So far, only small-scale cultures of the
microscopic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been
examined in the laboratory for their hydrogen production
capabilities, Melis said."
<P>
(((Give me a bottle!   I've got some stuff in the back of
the fridge that could be its twin brother.  Let's make
bathtub hydrogen!)))
<P>
<P>
"'In the future, both small-scale industrial and
commercial operations and larger utility photobioreactor
complexes can be envisioned using this process,' Melis
said.
<P>
((("Welcome to our Utility Photobioreactor Complex."  It
just sounds so... so 21st Century!)))
<P>
<P>
"While current production rates are not high enough
to make the process immediately viable commercially, the
researchers believe that yields could rise by at least 10
fold with further research, someday making the technique
an attractive fuel-producing option.
<P>
<P>
"Preliminary rough estimates, for instance, suggest
it is conceivable that a single, small commercial pond
could produce enough hydrogen gas to meet the weekly fuel
needs of a dozen or so automobiles, Melis said.
<P>
(((Did you hear that?  You can run a dozen cars off a pond
full of green scum!)))
<P>
<P>
"The scientific team is just beginning to test ways
to maximize hydrogen production, including varying the
particular type of microalga used and its growth
conditions. (...)
<P>
<P>
"'Hydrogen is so clean burning that what comes out of
the exhaust pipe is pure water,' Melis said. 'You can
drink it.'"
<P>
(((I wouldn't necessarily advise drinking the algae,
however.   At the very least, you'll be venting flammable
hydrogen  in highly embarrassing ways.)))
<P>
<P>
"Engineering advances for hydrogen storage,
transportation and utilization, many sponsored by the U.S.
DOE Hydrogen Program, are beginning to make the fuel
feasible to power automobiles and buses and to generate
electricity in this country, Seibert said.
<P>
(((What "transport"?  It's pond scum!  You just grow it on
site!)))
<P>
<P>
"'What has been lacking is a renewable source of
hydrogen,' he said.
<P>
(((That's true.  Green hydrogen has been a missing key
technology.  If this thing is for real, it really
transforms the prospects of the industry.)))
<P>
<P>
"For nearly 60 years, scientists have known that
certain types of algae can produce the gas in this way,
but only in trace amounts. Despite tinkering with the
process, no one has been able to make the yield rise
significantly without elaborate and costly procedures
until the UC Berkeley and NREL teams  made this discovery.
<P>
<P>
"The breakthrough, Melis said, was discovering what
he calls a 'molecular switch.'  This is a process by which
the cell's usual photosynthetic apparatus can be turned
off at will and the cell can be directed to use stored
energy with hydrogen as the byproduct.
<P>
<P>
"'The switch is actually very simple to activate,'
Melis said. 'It depends on the absence of an essential
element, sulfur, from the microalga growth  medium.'
<P>
<P>
"The absence of sulfur stops photosynthesis and thus
halts the cell's internal production of oxygen. Without
oxygen from any source, the anaerobic cells are not able
to burn stored fuel in the usual way, through metabolic
respiration. In order to survive, they are forced to
activate the alternative metabolic pathway, which
generates the hydrogen and may be universal in many types
of algae.
<P>
<P>
"'They're utilizing stored compounds and bleeding
hydrogen just to survive,' Melis said. 'It's probably an
ancient strategy that the organism developed to live in
sulfur-poor anaerobic conditions.'
<P>
(((So in other words, this isn't a genetically altered
organism.  It's a normal organism that has been
metabolically starved.  It'll be interesting to see the
reaction of the anti-genemod contingent here. Is it
"natural" or isn't it?)))
<P>
<P>
"He said the alga culture cannot live forever when it
is switched over to hydrogen production, but that it can
manage for a considerable period of time without negative
effects.
<P>
(((Imagine how they must smell after you feed them with
sulfur.)))
<P>
<P>
"The researchers first grow the alga
'photosynthetically, like every other plant on Earth,'
Melis said. This allows the green-colored microorganisms
to collect sunlight and accumulate a generous supply of
carbohydrates and other fuels.
<P>
<P>
"When enough energy has been banked in this manner,
the researchers tap it and turn it into hydrogen. To do
this, they transfer the liquid alga culture, which
resembles a lime-green soft drink, (((Oh yeah.  Wow.  I am
so with that)))  to stoppered one-liter glass bottles with
no sulfur present. Then the culture is allowed to consume
away all oxygen."  ((Kind of an Atkins Diet thing going on
here, basically.)))
<P>
<P>
"After about 24 hours, photosynthesis and normal
metabolic respiration stop, and hydrogen begins to bubble
to the top of the bottles and bleed off into tall,
hydrogen-collection glass tubes."
<P>
(((Are you listening, <A HREF="http://www.realgoods.com/">www.realgoods.com</A>?  It's a home
distillery unit.)))
<P>
<P>
"'It was actually a surprise when we detected
significant amounts of hydrogen coming out of the
culture,' Melis said. 'We thought we would get trace
amounts, but we got bulk amounts.'
(((Hey, that's just what the cold-fusion guys said,
too!)))
<P>
<P>
"After up to four days of generating an hourly
average of about three milliliters of hydrogen per liter
of culture, the culture is depleted of stored fuel and
must be allowed to return to photosynthesis. Then, two or
three days later, it again can be tapped for hydrogen,
Melis said.
<P>
<P>
"'The cell culture can go back and forth like this
many times,' Ghirardi said.
