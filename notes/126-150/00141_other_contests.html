"Energy Department and The American Institute of
Architects Announce 'Sun Wall' National Design Competition
for DOE Headquarters Building
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "$20,000 Prize for Design of Largest Federal
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Government Building Solar  Energy Installation in the
World
<P>
"Contact: Phil Simon, (202) 626-7463, <A HREF="mailto:psimon@aia.org">psimon@aia.org</A>
John B. Townsend II, Department of Energy, (202) 586-5806
<P>
"For Immediate Release
<P>
"WASHINGTON, D.C., February 28, 2000 == Secretary of
Energy Bill Richardson and The American Institute of
Architects President Ronald L. Skaggs, FAIA, today
announced a national design competition for the largest
federal government building solar energy system in the
world. In the process, the Department of Energy's (DOE)
Forrestal Building headquarters will become the home of
the world's largest 'Sun Wall.'
<P>
"'By demonstrating on our own headquarters building
that solar energy systems can be attractive as well as
practical, we will show the real benefits of clean energy
technologies available today,' said Secretary Richardson.
'Once completed, the solar energy project will join other
landmarks in our nation's capital.'
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Secretary Richardson added that architects,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
engineers and other design professionals who enter the
competition are ideally positioned == because of their
training and expertise == to successfully blend aesthetics
with complex, technological systems.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'Architects understand that the best design
</BLOCKQUOTE>
solutions are those that are not only practical, inviting,
and visually pleasing, but respectful of the environment
as well,' said AIA President Skaggs. 'This design
competition will offer a perfect example of how beauty and
grandeur can go hand-in-hand with environmental
sensitivity. We're pleased to play a role in a project
that will likely culminate in a beautifully designed and
environmentally sound facility that adds significantly to
the architectural landscape in the District.'  (((See,
folks, that's DC-centric "patrician-Viridian" rhetoric
there.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Architects, building design professionals, engineers
</BLOCKQUOTE>
and energy technology companies are invited to design a
technologically advanced and visually exciting solar
system for the south-facing wall of the department's
headquarters building in Washington, D.C.  (((I'm
especially liking this 'visually exciting' part.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The wall, which is currently blank, spans a space
</BLOCKQUOTE>
nearly two-thirds of an acre. The system could generate as
much as 200 kilowatts of electric power, enough energy for
more than 60 homes.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Once completed, the 'sun wall' will be the largest
</BLOCKQUOTE>
such solar energy system on any government building in the
United States and one of the largest such systems on any
building in the world.  (((Okay, who's got the BIGGEST
ONE?  Danes?  Germans? Israelis?  'Fess up!)))
<P>
(...)  "The 'Sun Wall' Design Competition officially
opens on March 1. The winning design will be selected by
an eminent jury of architects, design professionals and
solar energy experts. The contest will close on August 1,
2000, with the winning design scheduled to be announced
during Energy Awareness Month 2000 in October. The winning
design team will be awarded a $20,000 cash prize.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "DOE and the AIA jointly established the rules for
</BLOCKQUOTE>
the competition and determined the award categories.
Criteria for the contest, design specifications, rules of
entry and registration materials will be available on
March 1 on the Sun Wall Design competition website at
<A HREF="http://www.doe-sunwall.org/">www.doe-sunwall.org</A> or by contacting Dr. E. Jackson, Jr.,
The American Institute of Architects, 1735 New York
Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20006-5292, (202) 626-7446."

  "The idea behind the contest is that the rigid
</BLOCKQUOTE>
constraints of designing for the web are what force us to
get truly creative. Between servers and bandwidth, clients
and users, HTML and the DOM, browsers and platforms, our
conscience and our ego, we're left in a very small space
to find highly optimal solutions. Since the space we have
to explore is so small, we have to look harder, get more
creative; and that's what makes it all interesting. Just
celebrating that is all.

  "Entries will be judged according to four criteria:

browser with their own plug-ins and none of these will be
revealed.
