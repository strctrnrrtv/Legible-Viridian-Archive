<h2>"Revealed: how oil giant influenced Bush</h2>
<p><strong>"White House sought advice from Exxon on Kyoto stance</strong></P>

<P>by John Vidal, environment editor<BR>
Wednesday June 08 2005<BR>
The Guardian</P>

<P>"President's George Bush's decision not to sign the United States up to the Kyoto 
global warming treaty was partly a result of pressure from ExxonMobil, the world's most 
powerful oil company, and other industries, according to US State Department papers seen 
by the Guardian. <span class="bluetext">(((I can't understand why British journos somehow imagine that the Bush 
cadre, which is made up of American oil people, needs lots of pushing
from Exxon.  The Administration is a petrocracy.  It'll do anything and everything for oil 
&ndash; or rather, for
its own weird ideas about oil. Given how hard they've struggled for oil supplies, it's 
amazing how little
we've gotten.)))</span></P>

<P>"The documents, which emerged as Tony Blair visited
the White House for discussions on climate change
before next month's G8 meeting, reinforce widely-held
suspicions of how close the company is to the
administration and its role in helping to formulate
US policy. <span class="bluetext">(((I also find it curious that the British
press thinks that Tony Blair has more clout inside
the Beltway than Exxon-Mobil does.)))</span></P>

<P>"In briefing papers given before meetings to the
US under-secretary of state, Paula Dobriansky,
<span class="bluetext">(((Paula, a longtime Viridian bete noire)))</span> between
2001 and 2004, the administration is found thanking
Exxon executives for the company's 'active involvement'
in helping to determine climate change policy, and
also seeking its advice on what climate change
policies the company might find acceptable.</P>

<P>"Other papers suggest that Ms Dobriansky should sound
out Exxon executives and other anti-Kyoto business
groups on potential alternatives to Kyoto.</P>

<P>"Until now Exxon has publicly maintained that it had
no involvement in the US government's rejection of Kyoto.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Why does Exxon even bother with this charade?
Exxon could proclaim in the streets that the Bush
Administration is a wholly-owned Exxon subsidiary.
Who would do anything about that? The Justice
Department?  The Congress?  Come on.)))</span>  But the
documents, obtained by Greenpeace under US freedom
of information legislation, suggest this is not
the case. <span class="bluetext">((("Suggest"? Read on.)))</span></P>

<P>"'Potus [president of the United States] rejected
Kyoto in part based on input from you and the Global
Climate Coalition,' says one briefing note before
Ms Dobriansky's meeting with the GCC, the main
anti-Kyoto US industry group, which was dominated
by Exxon.  <span class="bluetext">(((The GCC no longer exists, which is not too surprising as the  Global Climate 
Coalition was an
odious astroturf sock-puppet from the get-go.
They're gone, but the briefing notes still remain!)))</span></P>

<P>"The papers further state that the White House
considered Exxon 'among the companies most actively
and prominently opposed to binding approaches like
Kyoto to cut greenhouse gas emissions'.  <span class="bluetext">((("Among"
the companies?  Okay, as a matter of strict accuracy,
there may be a coal company or two who are even
more reprehensible than Exxon. But they're all
so much smaller.)))</span></P>

<P>"But in evidence to the UK House of Lords science
and technology committee in 2003, Exxon's head of
public affairs, Nick Thomas, said: 'I think we can
say categorically we have not campaigned with the
United States government or any other government
to take any sort of position over Kyoto.'  <span class="bluetext">(((Does
Parliament plan to extradite this Exxon guy
for perjury somehow?  He's the head of their PR
department!  They should have counted the spoons
before he left the dining hall in the House of
Lords.)))</span></P>

<P>"Exxon, officially the US's most valuable company
valued at $379bn (L163bn) earlier this year, is
seen in the papers to share the White House's
unwavering scepticism of international efforts to
address climate change.  <span class="bluetext">(((It isn't 'skepticism,'
it's deliberate, long-term obstructionism.)))</span></P>

<P>"The documents, which reflect unanimity between the
company and the US administration on the need for
more global warming science and the unacceptable
costs of Kyoto, state that Exxon believes that
joining Kyoto 'would be unjustifiably drastic and
premature'.</P>

<P>"This line has been taken consistently by President
Bush, and was expected to be continued in yesterday's
talks with Tony Blair who has said that climate
change is 'the most pressing issue facing mankind'.
<span class="bluetext">(((Well, then there you have it:  America's Biggest
Corporation Versus Mankind's Most Pressing Issue.
Unfortunately for Exxon, the laws of physics are not
subject to repeal. So it'll take a while, but
Exxon-Mobil gonna get pressed to death.  I wonder if,
in the end, they'll simply fold their tents and scamper
from the scene of the crime like the Global Climate
Coalition, or try somehow to go down loudly
fighting.)))</span></P>

<DL>
  <DT>Link</DT><DD>It may be that they'll die of old age.
  Oil is an old guy's business nowadays, and the
  numbers of employees, especially in America,
  are dwindling.<br>

  </DD></DL>

<P>"'President Bush tells Mr Blair he's concerned about
climate change, but these documents reveal the alarming
truth, that policy in this White House is being
written by the world's most powerful oil company.
This administration's climate policy is a menace
to humanity,' said Stephen Tindale, Greenpeace's
executive director in London last night.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It's so pleasant to hear sentiments like this
in major news media.  Exxon is becoming ever more
blatant, arrogant and clumsy, transforming its
temporary dominance over one American administration
into a devastating future role as a vast global
hate-object.  Exxon will probably become the fall-guy
for climate change. The downfall of mighty Exxon
be enough to cause most other climate obscurantists
to recant and/or flee.  After that act of lustration
we could get on with the hard work of climate
restoration.)))</span></P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"ExxonMobil, which was yesterday contacted by the
Guardian in the US but did not return calls,
<span class="bluetext">(((surprise)))</span> is spending millions of pounds on an
advertising campaign aimed at influencing politicians,
opinion formers and business leaders in the UK and
other pro-Kyoto countries in the weeks before the G8
meeting at Gleneagles."  <span class="bluetext">(((Why talk to reporters in
the tiny 'news hole' when you can just
fill the paper with vaunting full-page ads?
Mobil discovered that decades ago.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((So, how did the Exxon-White House operation
work, exactly?)))</span></P>

<h2>"White House sexed-down climate change reports</h2>

<P>By Lucy Sherriff</P>

<P>Published Thursday 9th June 2005 10:36?GMT</P>


<P>"Official White House policy documents on climate
change were altered by a former oil-industry lobbyist
to play down the link between greenhouse gases and
global warming, it emerged yesterday.</P>

<P>"Philip Cooney, the chief of staff for the White
House council on environmental quality, altered
several draft reports in 2002 and 2003, after they
had been approved by government scientists, despite
having no scientific background himself. Much of
his editing made it into final versions of reports.</P>

<P>"Many of the changes were very simple. For instance,
in one case he added the words 'significant and
fundamental' before the word 'uncertainties.' In
another, he added the word 'extremely' to the
sentence:  'The attribution of the causes of
biological and ecological changes to climate
change or variability is extremely difficult.'</P>

<P>"Others were more blatant. According to the New
York Times, Cooney deleted an entire paragraph
dealing with the impact of global warming on
glaciers and the polar ice cap from a 2002 report
that discussed the effect global warming might
have on flooding and water availability.
Cooney noted in the margins that the paragraph
was 'straying from research strategy into
speculative findings/musings.'</P>

<P>"In all cases, the amendments cast doubt on
scientific results that are increasingly accepted
as robust by the scientific community, and by the
general populace.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Who's Philip Cooney? Well, he was instrumental
in getting Exxon's favorite think-tank,
Competitive Enterprise Institute, to sue the Bush
Administration over global warming while he,
Cooney, was in the Bush Administration.)))</span>
<A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~gov_affairs/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&Affiliation=R&PressRelease_id=496&Month=9&Year=2003">http://www.senate.gov/~gov_affairs/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.<br>Detail&amp;Affiliation=R&amp;PressRelease_id=496&amp;Month=9&amp;Year=2003</A></P>

<P>"Cooney is a lawyer by training, with a degree in
economics. Before going to work at the White House,
Cooney was the climate team leader at the American
Petroleum Institute, a trade body that represents
the oil industry's interests.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((In case you are losing track of the multiple
facades here:)))</span><br>
Link: <A HREF="http://www.exxonsecrets.org">http://www.exxonsecrets.org</A></P>


<P>"The documents came to light via a non-profit
organisation that provides legal assistance to
government whistle blowers. The Government
Accountability Project is representing Rick Piltz,
formerly a senior associate in the office that
issued the reports. Piltz resigned from his position
in March.</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.whistleblower.org/template/index.cfm">http://www.whistleblower.org/template/index.cfm</A></P>

<P>"'Each administration has a policy position on
climate change,' he wrote in a document reported
by The New York Times. 'But I have not seen a
situation like the one that has developed under
this administration during the past four years,
in which politicization by the White House has
fed back directly into the science program in
such a way as to undermine the credibility and
integrity of the program.'</P>

<P>"White House officials deny that they are politicising
science.  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder why they still bother.  Why not
simply declare that science should be subservient to
religion and politics?  It sure works for Islam.)))</span></P>

<P>"At a press conference this week, President Bush told
reporters he believed America is at the forefront of
research into climate change. Asked whether he
thought climate change was caused by man, he replied:
'I've always said it's a serious long-term issue
that needs to be dealt with. My administration isn't
waiting around to deal with it; we're acting. We
want to know more about it. Easier to solve a
problem when you know a lot about it.'  <span class="bluetext">(((A
blatantly oxymoronic utterance, but after so many,
who's counting?)))</span></P>

<P>"Meanwhile, academics from 11 countries, including
the US and Britain, distributed an open letter saying:
'The scientific understanding of climate change is
now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking
prompt action.'  <span class="bluetext">(((The academics are so over; from
now on,  it's all about frightened CEOs demanding
the very same thing.)))</span></P>

<P>"UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has been in the US
trying to persuade Bush to commit the US to
reducing its greenhouse emissions. The president
has called for voluntary measures, but has made no
firm promises."</P>

<span class="bluetext">(((Here's the payoff &ndash; after Cooney scampered from
  the glare of the public limelight, Exxon simply hired
  him immediately.  We're living in a true Gilded
  Age &ndash; except that Exxon's heaps of gilt are so
  thoroughly splattered with oil, blood and soot.)))</span>

<P>"Philip A. Cooney, the former White House staff member
who repeatedly revised government scientific reports
on global warming, will go to work for Exxon Mobil
this fall, the oil company said yesterday.</P>

  <DT>RELATED</DT><DD>Bush Aide Softened Greenhouse Gas Links to
  Global Warming (June 8, 2005)  <span class="bluetext">(((Nice of the
  New York Times web team to do the linking for us.)))</span>
  </DD></DL>

<P>"Mr. Cooney resigned as chief of staff for President
Bush's environmental policy council on Friday, two
days after documents obtained by The New York Times
revealed that he had edited the reports in ways that
cast doubt on the link between the emission of
greenhouse gases and rising temperatures.</P>

<P>"A former lawyer and lobbyist with the American
Petroleum Institute, the main lobbying group for
the oil industry, Mr. Cooney has no scientific
training. The White House, which said on Friday
that there was no connection between last week's
disclosure and Mr. Cooney's resignation, repeated
yesterday that his actions were part of the normal
review process for documents on environmental issues
involving many government agencies.  <span class="bluetext">(((Really? Wow!
How convenient!)))</span></P>

<P>"'Phil Cooney did a great job,' said Dana Perino,
a deputy spokeswoman for the White House, 'and we
appreciate his public service and the work that he
did, and we wish him well in the private sector.'
<span class="bluetext">(((In point of fact, the guy never left the
private sector in the first place.)))</span></P>

<P>"An Exxon spokesman, Tom Cirigliano, declined to
describe Mr. Cooney's new job. Mr. Cooney did not
respond to e-mail or phone messages.  <span class="bluetext">(((I kinda
hope that Phil is retiring to a Florida beach home
that gets swiftly washed away.)))</span></P>

<P>"Exxon Mobil has long financed advertising and
lobbying efforts that question whether warming
caused by humans poses risks serious enough to
justify curbing carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse
gas emitted by smokestacks and tailpipes.</P>

<P>"Mr. Cirigliano said yesterday that the company
was committed to acting responsibly on the issue.</P>

<P>"'Exxon Mobil has taken, is taking and will continue
to take tangible actions to reduce emissions in our
operations, as well as in customer use of our
products, and to better understand and prepare for
the risks of climate change,' Mr. Cirigliano said.
<span class="bluetext">(((They are evil and belong in prison.  And they're
getting wilder and scarier as they themselves
realize that this is true.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The British take on matters is pleasingly wry.)))</span></P>

<P>"Bush's climate row aide joins oil giant</P>

<P>Jamie Wilson in Washington<br>
Thursday June 16, 2005<BR>
The Guardian</P>

<P>"A senior White House official accused of doctoring
government reports on climate change to play down
the link between greenhouse gas emissions and
global warming has taken a job with ExxonMobil,
the world's largest oil company.</P>

<P>"Philip Cooney, who resigned as chief of staff of
the White House council on environment quality at
the weekend, will begin work at the oil giant in
the autumn.  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder why the Bush Administration
even HAS a "council on environment quality."  It's
not like the cadre around the Oval Office would pay any
attention to a council's counselling.)))</span></P>

<P>"Politicians and environmental groups in Washington
condemned the move yesterday. 'At a minimum it creates
a terrible appearance,' said Henry Waxman, a
Democratic Congressman who sits on the committee
for government reform. 'This is one of the fastest
revolving doors I have seen.'  <span class="bluetext">(((The secret?
There's no door there.)))</span></P>

<P>"Kert Davies, the US research director for Greenpeace,
said: 'The cynical way to look at this is that
ExxonMobil has removed its sleeper cell from the
White House and extracted him back to the mother ship.'
<span class="bluetext">(((I don't see why that's 'cynical.' It does
sound a tad science-fictional.)))</span></P>

<P>"It emerged last week that Mr Cooney, who has a law
degree and no scientific training, watered down
scientific papers on climate change and played
up uncertainties in the scientific literature.</P>

<P>"He had previously worked for the American Petroleum
Institute, a lobby group that was vocal in countering
the virtual consensus by scientists that manmade
emissions are warming the planet.</P>

<P>"A White House spokeswoman told the Associated Press
his resignation was 'completely unrelated' to the
disclosure in the New York Times two days earlier
that he had made changes in several government
climate change reports issued in 2002 and 2003.
<span class="bluetext">(((I guess it's also completely unrelated to
Dr. Piltz, a whistleblower who sacrificed his
14-year government science career to expose this
malefactor.)))</span></P>

<P>"'Mr Cooney had long been considering his options
following four years of service to the administration,'
she said.</P>

<P>"Bush administration policy on global warming has
generally echoed that of the oil lobby, emphasising
doubt over climate change science and focusing on
the need for further research.</P>


<P>"An ExxonMobil spokesman said Mr Cooney had been
hired before the doctoring stories broke."
<span class="bluetext">(((I don't doubt they promised Cooney that job
four years ago.  To abandon such a highly-placed
agent in his time of woe would only discourage
the others.)))</span></P>
