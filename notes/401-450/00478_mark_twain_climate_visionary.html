Key concepts: 
</dt> <dd>Samuel Clemens, fiction, climate change</dd>

<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt> <dd>Mark Twain's
novel "The American Claimant" was published in
1892.  It involves a daffy American inventor trying
to sell climate change.  Hey, it's an old book,
but that was news to me.</dd></DL>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The speaker quoted here in the last words
of Twain's novel is Colonel Mulberry Sellers,
a deluded American genius.)))</span></P>

<P>"This grand new idea of mine == the sublimest I have
ever conceived, will save me whole, I am sure.  I am
leaving for San Francisco this moment, to test
it, by the help of the great Lick telescope.</P>

<P>"Like all of my more notable discoveries and
inventions, it is based upon hard, practical scientific
laws; all other bases are unsound and hence
untrustworthy.</P>

<P>"In brief, then, I have conceived the stupendous idea
of reorganizing the climates of the earth according
to the desire of the populations interested.</P>

<P>"That is to say, I will furnish climates to order,
for cash or negotiable paper, taking the old climates
in part payment, of course, at a fair discount, where
they are in condition to be repaired at small cost and
let out for hire to poor and remote communities not
able to afford a good climate and not caring for an
expensive one for mere display.</P>

<P>"My studies have convinced me that the regulation of
climates and the breeding of new varieties at will
from the old stock is a feasible thing.  Indeed I am
convinced that it has been done before; done in
prehistoric times by now forgotten and unrecorded
civilizations.</P>

<P>"Everywhere I find hoary evidences of artificial
manipulation of climates in bygone times.  Take
the glacial period.  Was that produced by accident?
Not at all; it was done for money.  I have a thousand
proofs of it, and will some day reveal them.</P>


<P>"I will confide to you an outline of my idea.  It is
to utilize the spots on the sun == get control of
them, you understand, and apply the stupendous
energies which they wield to beneficent purposes
in the reorganizing of our climates.  At present
they merely make trouble and do harm in the
evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric
storms; but once under humane and intelligent control
this will cease and they will become a boon to man.</P>

<P>"I have my plan all mapped out, whereby I hope and
expect to acquire complete and perfect control of
the sun-spots, also details of the method whereby
I shall employ the same commercially; but I will
not venture to go into particulars before the patents
shall have been issued.  I shall hope and expect to
sell shop-rights to the minor countries at a
reasonable figure and supply a good business article
of climate to the great empires at special rates,
together with fancy brands for coronations, battles
and other great and particular occasions.  There are
billions of money in this enterprise, no expensive
plant is required, and I shall begin to realize in
a few days == in a few weeks at furthest.</P>

<P>"I shall stand ready to pay cash for Siberia the
moment it is delivered, and thus save my honor and
my credit.  I am confident of this.</P>

<P>"I would like you to provide a proper outfit and
start north as soon as I telegraph you, be it night
or be it day.  I wish you to take up all the
country stretching away from the north pole on all
sides for many degrees south, and buy Greenland and
Iceland at the best figure you can get now while
they are cheap.  It is my intention to move one of
the tropics up there and transfer the frigid zone
to the equator.  I will have the entire Arctic
Circle in the market as a summer resort next year,
and will use the surplusage of the old climate,
over and above what can be utilized on the equator,
to reduce the temperature of opposition resorts.</P>

<P>"But I have said enough to give you an idea of
the prodigious nature of my scheme and the feasible
and enormously profitable character of it.</P>

<P>"I shall join all you happy people in England as
soon as I shall have sold out some of my principal
climates and arranged with the Czar about Siberia.</P>


<P>"Meantime, watch for a sign from me.  Eight days
from now, we shall be wide asunder; for I shall be
on the border of the Pacific, and you far out on
the Atlantic, approaching England.  That day, if
I am alive and my sublime discovery is proved and
established, I will send you greeting, and my
messenger shall deliver it where you are, in the
solitudes of the sea; for I will waft a vast
sun-spot across the disk like drifting smoke,
and you will know it for my love-sign, and will
say 'Mulberry Sellers throws us a kiss across
the universe.'"</P>
