"GE to invest more in green technology"
<span class="bluetext">((("GE defects to Greenhouse believers,
Exxon-Mobil doomed")))</span></P>

<P>"WASHINGTON (AFP) May 09, 2005
"General Electric Co. announced plans Monday to
double its investment in 'cleaner technologies' for
energy, transportation and other areas in a major
new environmental initiative.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Have a look at the way GE is slanting this.
It's kind of brilliant, actually.  Look how
GE CEO J. Immelt actually transmutes, right on
the web, into a green silhouette!  Boy did that
make me happy.)))</span>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Meanwhile, Exxon-Mobil attempts to cover
their massively profiteering while still
uttering not a word about climate change:)))</span>
<br><a href="http://www2.exxonmobil.com/corporate/Campaign/Campaign_energysaving_conservation.asp">http://www2.exxonmobil.com/corporate/Campaign/Campaign_energysaving_conservation.asp</A></P>

<P>
"GE, the world's biggest company in terms of market
capitalization, <span class="bluetext">(((ha ha ha, it's all downhill
from here, tra la la)))</span> called the announcement
an 'initiative  to aggressively bring to market
new technologies  that will help customers meet
pressing environmental challenges."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((You know what's nice about GE?  Unlike, say,
Enron, GE can actually execute business plans!
For instance, GE now owns Enron's wind power.
You wonder how GE bought all that wind stuff for
a song from the wreckage of a cratered company?
Because they're NOT STUPID at GE, that's why!)))</span></P>

<P>"The company will invest 1.5 billion dollars annually
on the research by 2010, up from the current level
of 700 million dollars, aimed at developing new
products and technologies. GE said it would also
work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of its
own operations and that of its customers."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Before you wax all Greenpeace and start griping,
"Gosh, a mere one and a half billion sure isn't much
compared to GE's bloated capitalist exploiter
profits," consider that Exxon-Mobil spent only
about eight million dollars and logjammed Kyoto
with that for years on end.)))</span>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Meanwhile, the Swiss are swaddling their
melting glaciers in a doomed attempt to
save their tourism industry:)))</span>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((What do you think will happen when the Swiss have
to swaddle the glaciers at the Davos Forum?
The Swiss have a lot of money.  How much cash
to you think it would take to hire the whores
at Exxon's Competitive Enterprise Institute?
For eight million dollars == (cheaper every year, given
the decline of the dollar)  == the Swiss could hire
the Republican echo chamber themselves  and put
everyone  in Exxon-Mobil under indictment.)))</span></P>

<P>"GE chairman Jeff Immelt, in a Washington speech,
<span class="bluetext">(((nice choice of venue, Jeff)))</span> said the program
is called 'ecomagination.'
<span class="bluetext">(((Kind of a clumsy coinage, but, well, I don't
think Jeff hired any science fiction writers to
invent his neologisms.)))</span></P>

<P>"'Ecomagination is GE's commitment to address
challenges such as the need for cleaner, more
efficient sources of energy, reduced emissions
and abundant sources of clean water,' Immelt said.
<span class="bluetext">(((I want to see somebody come out against that
on the floor of the US Congress.)))</span></P>

<P>"'And we plan to make money doing it. Increasingly
for business, 'green' is green."
<span class="bluetext">(((It certainly is if the market says it is.
If investors get the feeling that fossil companies
are too "exposed" to the mayhem, all bets are off.)))</span>

The Institutional Investor Summit on Climate Risk</P>

<P>"He said the company hopes to take in revenues of
20 billion dollars a year on these products by 2010,
double the current level."</P>


<P>"Immelt said the initiative will include more
environmentally friendly technology for wind and
solar energy, hybrid locomotives, fuel cells,
lower-emission aircraft engines, lighter and
stronger materials, efficient lighting and water
purification technology.  <span class="bluetext">(((I hope Amory Lovins
is a happy guy today.)))</span></P>

<P>"The company has operations ranging from aircraft
engines to insurance to film and broadcasting,
and manufactures products ranging from light bulbs
to medical scanners.</P>

<P>"'We will establish partnerships with our customers
to tackle their most pressing environmental challenges
and double our research spending to develop the
products and services they need,' Immelt said. 'And
we will use these technologies to improve our own
energy efficiency and environmental performance.'</P>

<P>"Immelt was joined in his appearance at George
Washington University by Jonathan Lash, president
of the Washington-based World Resources Institute.</P>

<P>"'This is a hugely important step by one of the
world's most important companies,' Lash was quoted
as saying in a GE statement. <span class="bluetext">(((He said that because
it's true.)))</span></P>

<P>"'It is particularly encouraging that GE is focusing
its research on cleaner technologies and making a
serious, meaningful and accountable commitment to
achieve stabilization of greenhouse gases that
contribute to climate change.'</P>


<P>"'Other companies represented at the session were
American Electric Power, Boeing, Canadian Pacific
Railway, Cinergy, Delphi and Pardee Homes."
<span class="bluetext">(((I wonder where BP, Shell, and Xerox were.
Oh well == they'll show up, they have to.)))</span></P>
