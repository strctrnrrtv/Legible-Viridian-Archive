<h2>"Former site of weapons production in Colorado opens as wildlife
refuge</h2>

<P>4/19/04</P>

<P>"COMMERCE CITY, Colorado (AP) A chunk of the former Rocky Mountain
Arsenal, where defense workers produced deadly sarin nerve gas,
mustard gas and napalm for four decades, opens this weekend as a
national wildlife refuge.</P>

<P>"Rolling prairie that once was the most contaminated 1 square mile
in America is now home to more than 300 species, from white pelicans
to foxes to bald eagles.  <font color="#0000FF">(((Every story along this line seems to
trot out bald eagles.  Bald eagles are the signature bird of
American involuntary parks.)))</P>

<P>'Interior Secretary Gale Norton, preparing for Saturday's opening of
the first phase of the refuge, said the project will serve as both
a habitat and an oasis of open space in the increasingly urban
Denver suburbs.</P>

<P>''It is a wonderful legacy,' Norton said Friday.</P>

<P>"Not everyone is convinced opening the site to the public is a good
idea.  <font color="#0000FF">(((Oh, quit spoiling the fun!  Just try not to mistake an
involuntary park for actual wilderness, and for heaven's sake
don't eat anything that you poach there. Oh wait == are you
a poacher?  Then go ahead and eat that!)))</P>

<P>"The arsenal is a Superfund site, still undergoing a cleanup
expected to cost $2.2 billion.</P>

<P>"Ten small  <font color="#0000FF">((("small"?))) sarin gas bombs were found during
cleanup in 2000 and 2001, four years after historic tours of the
facility had begun. Six weeks ago, a canister designed to hold
sarin in a weapon called an Honest John rocket was found;
it contained only water.</P>

<P>"'That site should never have been and should never be open to the
public,'' said Adrienne Anderson, a University of Colorado
professor and environmental activist.  <font color="#0000FF">(((Oh knock it off
you big baby.)))</P>

<P>"Sandra Horrocks of the Sierra Club said it may be too early to open
the refuge.</P>

<P>"'We are worried. I think it just doesn't make sense to have people
near a hazardous waste cleanup site while the cleanup is going
on,' said Horrocks, chairwoman of the arsenal committee for the
Colorado branch of the Sierra Club.  <font color="#0000FF">(((First, we're
ALL near hazardous waste cleanup sites, and second, it's
kind of marvelous that the Colorado Sierra Club has an
"arsenal committee.")))</P>

<P>"Some environmental groups support the conversion.</P>

<P>"Stephen Torbit, director of the Rocky Mountain Resource Center of
the National Wildlife Federation, said eagles and other wildlife
are the ecosystem's best barometer.  'And they are doing just
fine,' he said. <font color="#0000FF">(((Well, yeah, at least till climate change gets 'em.)))</P>

<P>"'Our assessment is that this is the best and highest use for that
land == a wildlife oasis in the middle of the concrete jungle of
Denver,' said Torbit.</P>

<P>"The arsenal sits on 17,000 acres (6,800 hectares) of grassland 10
miles (16 kilometers) northeast of downtown Denver. Perched at the
foot of the Rocky Mountains with commanding views of the city, the
area is dotted with small manmade lakes. Deer amble across empty
roads and tumbleweeds roll past.  <font color="#0000FF">(((Most of the American West
could look like that if they get enough water shortages.)))</P>

<P>"Officials noted more than 500,000 people have been through the
area, without problems, on controlled public tours since 1996.
Dean Rundle, who manages the refuge for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, said the area had been closely studied by experts, who
even compared 1938 photos of prairie dog towns with current photos
to look for signs of contamination.</P>

<P>"'I'm just really confident we are not going to have any issues
with chemical agents,' Rundle said.  <font color="#0000FF">(((Unless we truck in a
few ourselves.)))</P>
