version of a rather silly British newspaper story
about Pentagon climate-change speculations.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00402_metropolis_editorial.html" >00402: Metropolis Editorial</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>It's a magazine

<li> <a href="401-450/00404_car_ergonomics.html" >00404: Car Ergonomics</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>I found this article
to be witty, insightful and delightful, but then again,
I just bought a hybrid electric Honda Civic 
with a highly unorthodox instrument panel.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00405_americas_radioactive_involuntary_parks.html" >00405: America's Radioactive Involuntary Parks</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>wonk-speak written

<li> <a href="401-450/00407_aromatizer_contest.html" >00407: Aromatizer Contest</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Contest entries are
tumbling in at an unheard-of rate.  I am pitchforking

to smell.]</li>
  
<li> <a href="401-450/00408_clouds_of_scent.html" >00408: Clouds of Scent</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Even more

lots of astonishing pictures from NASA.]</li>
  
<li> <a href="401-450/00409_green_social_software.html" >00409: Green Social Software</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>It's a stirring
  call to arms from people who have called to
  the American population into the righteous streets
  for, oh, forty years or something. Also

  entries in the Viridian Aromatizer Contest.]</li> 
  
<li> <a href="401-450/00410_sterling_book_tour.html" >00410: Sterling Book Tour</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Who cares

<li> <a href="401-450/00414_the_reek.html" >00414: The Reek</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Contains

Contest.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00415_doom_is_nigh.html" >00415: Doom Is Nigh</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Spooky, disconcerting, contrarian, and goes on and on and on.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00416_enron_on_tape.html" >00416: Enron on Tape</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Americans, these
people put your President into office.  Californians,
you lost a governor over this, not to mention a
whole, whole lot of your money.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00417_live_from_croatia.html" >00417: Live from Croatia</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>I'm in Croatia trying to clean up a backlog of files. Not too well organized, but, well, I've been busy elsewhere.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00418_notes_from_high_ground.html" >00418: Notes from High Ground</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>I was in Colorado at
this event, and discussing a book that I'm writing on
design.  Okay, it's a big pamphlet.  But it will have
some new ideas in it.]</li>
<li> <a href="401-450/00419_wonder_bug.html" >00419: Wonder Bug</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>continues the long-term
Viridian obsession with micro-organisms and their
applications.]</li>
<li> <a href="401-450/00420_viridian_toilet_humor.html" >00420: Viridian Toilet Humor</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>We Viridians don't
normally dabble in bathroom humor, but these peculiar
snippets were assembled by a curator we know who
works for the Guggenheim Museum. This is more
than toilet humor &ndash; this is, like, toilet art.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00421_the_virtual_actual.html" >00421: The Virtual Actual</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>I'm keynoting SIGGRAPH
in a few days, so I'm getting up to speed on all things
virtual.  None of the stuff in this Note is really
working yet, but, being a futurist, that's why I'm
interested.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00422_the_spime.html" >00422: The Spime</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> the Pope-Emperor

of the end-using masses.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00422_photovoltaic_display_screen.html" >00423: Photovoltaic Display Screen</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> It's a wacky,
overpriced solar-power knickknack, but every
red-blooded Viridian is bound to want one.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00423_korean_involuntary_park.html" >00424: Korean Involuntary Park</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> Full of daffy local
color, but from a widely known New York publication.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00425_hurricanes_vs_phones.html" >00425: Hurricanes vs Phones</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> None.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00426_foot_augmentation.html" >00426: Foot Augmentation.</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> time-consuming links to bizarre curiosities that may well make a Segway look as practical as a can-opener. You probably shouldn't have read that last Viridian Note, the one that
came without any Attention Conservation Notice.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00427_six_viridian_years.html" >00427: Six Viridian Years</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> There is so much going on here that even I can't pay attention to it..]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00428_anybody_but_americans.html" >00428: Anybody but Americans</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> This may be the last Viridian Note you read this year, 
because I'm wintering in Belgrade, Serbia.  Once I'm teaching design in Pasadena, however, 
you can expect all Viridian hell to break loose.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00429_visionary_contest.html" >00429: Visionary Contest</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>There's been very little Viridian traffic lately.  That 
will change soon.
This is an excellent opportunity to resign from the list if email has you overwhelmed.  
Also, there is a new Viridian Design Contest afoot with a particularly attractive 
prize.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00430_goodbye_cruel_world.html" >00430: Goodbye, Cruel World</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>so colossally grim<BR>
that it's exhilirating.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00431_lord_oxburgh.html" >00431: Lord Oxburgh</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Go thou and
do likewise, and sin no more.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00432_ten_gallons_of_kyoto.html" >00432: Ten Gallons of Kyoto</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>This is
impossible for  human beings to read.  Yet
I read it all, I really did.  I might
have made it to the end without unconsciousness
ensuing, but it was written by Canadian
policy wonks.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00433_treehugger.html" >00433: Treehugger</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Offers actual pay

of Ukrainians.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00436_viva_california.html" >00436: Viva California</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>lacks
corruption-crazed coal-mining Ukrainians,
features sun-dazzled Californians.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00437_energy_security.html" >00437: Energy Security</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>contains
blathering, barking Yankee political operatives.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00438_delhian_doors_of_perception.html" >00438: Delhian Doors of Perception</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>I didn't go
to India. I bet a lot of you didn't, either.
John Thackara,on the other hand, will charge
right on over there, throw a big design event,
and report at length afterward.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00439_the_archbishop_of_canterbury.html" >00439: The Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>It's an enviro sermon
by the Archbishop of Canterbury.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00440_ian_mcewan.html" >00440: Ian McEwan</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>You may have never
heard of critically acclaimed novelist Ian McEwan,
and besides, his award-winning novels are
grief-stricken, 'difficult,' depressing
and British.]</li>

<li> <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/401-450/00441_get_a_job_hippie" >00441: Get a Job, Hippie</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>You may already
have a job.  This one may be better than
the one you have, though.  It's in Seattle.]</li>

<li> <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/401-450/00442_redesigning_iowa" >00442: Redesigning Iowa</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>"Iowa."  Where's that?
Do they mean "Ohio"?  We always get those confused.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00443_spanish_wind_boom.html" >00443: Spanish Wind Boom</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Europeans who get
rich from  green energy can be almost as 
enviable and obnoxious as the oil-soaked 
Texan nouveau riche.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00444_ecoimagination.html" >00444: Ecoimagination</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>If you don't consider
this development a big deal, then you probably don't
belong on this mailing list. Send me some  email,
I'll prune you off pronto.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00445_green_design_debacles.html" >00445: Green Design Debacles</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Just because green

easy, or even that it works at all.]</li>

could consume a couple of days, maybe even a week.</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00449_the_mad_max_scenario.html" >00449: The Mad Max Scenario</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Could consume most of
an afternoon in febrile handwringing and left-wing
schadenfreude.]</li>

<li> <a href="401-450/00450_rude_calamity.html" >00450: Rude Calamity</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>May briefly deprive attention from the awesome fate of New Orleans.]</li>
