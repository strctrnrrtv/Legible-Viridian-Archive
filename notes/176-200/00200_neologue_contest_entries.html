fuel gauge and odometer.  When the voice-recognition
apparatus perceives the driver saying, "Damn!  The price
of gas is outrageous!", a projected display pops up
indicating gas mileage, the price of operating the car,
and the CO2 generated, year-to-date, by the vehicle.

<P>Okay. Recognition Engines. Small gizmos. These are clearly
what they used as the door-locking mechanism on the Gates
of Moria in The Lord of the Rings. You could probably sell
a few of those to Tolkien fans, who could thereafter take
comfort in the thought that their apartment was burgled by
a fellow enthusiast.</P>

<A NAME="Section_1"> </A>
<H2>1. Build one into a microphone. If it hears you say "Is  this thing on? (tap tap tap)",
 it automatically switches</H2>

<P>on. Optionally, if you say "Can you hear me in the back?"
[pause] "No?", it'll turn up the volume.</P>

<P>1a. Wish-fulfillment device: A microphone that slowly
turns down the volume if it hears one of several
designated words or phrases. You should be able to
reprogram it on the fly, possibly by sampling a fellow-
panelist saying that obnoxious phrase while you hold down
the Reprogram button.</P>

<A NAME="Section_2"> </A>
<H2>2. Hook up a Recognition Engine to the pickups on your  musical instrument so it'll 
automatically readjust your</H2>

<P>settings, filters, effects boxes, etc., when it hears the
opening notes of your next song, or when you announce the
title of the next song.</P>

<A NAME="Section_3"> </A>
<H2>3. For the very deaf, a small gizmo that vibrates when you  say their name. It cues 
them to turn around and look at</H2>

<P>you so they can read your lips.</P>

  <P>obvious: safewording machinery.<BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Simplest version: you say "Off!", it goes off. This is
suitable for dangerous machines you use one at a time.</P>

<P>Where lots of machines are being operated, you could tell
the Recognition Engines to  respond to machine-specific
commands ("Off [lathe]!"), or to some uncommon word. You
could also teach Recognition Engines to interpret your
favorite profanities and obscenities as instructions to
shut down dangerous machinery.</P>

<A NAME="Section_5"> </A>
<H2>5. Safeword guns. If you don't know the code word, it  won't fire.  A second code word will turn the gun off if</H2>

<P>someone takes it away from you.</P>

<A NAME="Section_6"> </A>
<H2>6. It would be useful to have a voice-operable power strip  with separately programmable slots. This isn't wildly</H2>

<P>creative, but it would be easy to make and you wouldn't
have to retrofit REs into your existing devices.
<BR></P>

<P>More notions may follow. This is fun.</P>

<P>"shut up" "stop" "quit" or "that's all"
puts active device in standby mode</P>

<P>&lt;name of device&gt;
puts standby device in active mode.</P>

<P>"help"
lists major commands.</P>

<P>"xxx help" or "help xxx"
gives canned presentation describing xxx == how
to use it, options, that sort of thing.
<BR></P>

<P>Imagining that the device has some kind of mobility:</P>

<P>"left"
"right"
"forward"
"reverse"
"faster"
"slower"
"slow down"
"slow"
"speed up"
<BR></P>

<P>Note that standby mode should also render it immobile.
<BR></P>

<P>Imagining that it's the tv set:</P>

<P>"louder"
"softer"  "quieter"
"next" [channel]
"last" or "previous" [channel]
&lt;number&gt;  [also specifies channel]</P>

<P>More fun is imagining fine tuning == for this you want to
do something like:
<BR></P>


<P>"tv"  'yes?'  "fine tune" 'ok'
<BR></P>


<P>"up" [pause] "there" [pause] "back a bit" [pause] "there"</P>


<P>Here, "up" and "down" indicate which way to turn, "back a
bit" indicates the reverse of the last explicitly stated
direction, "there" indicates to stop tuning.  It would
probably be worthwhile conducting a few surveys to find
commonly used equivalents.</P>


<P>Imagining it's the coffee pot, you'd want to come up with
a vocabulary describing how dark, how much, and
optionally, when to have it ready. The coffee pot would
initially have to ask for each of these that are
unspecified, but could use "same as last time" as the
default.  However, I don't drink coffee.
<BR></P>


<P>Finally, imagining it's the garage door:</P>


<P>"open"
"close"</P>

<P>My first thoughts turned to medical applications that
'listen' to you and respond appropriately.</P>

<P>Bloodflow, for example to the temples, exceeds a
threshold. The device whispers "relax," dims the lights a
bit, and releases soothing aromatherapy.</P>

<P>Bloodflow to other, uh, sensitive areas occurs. The lights
dim again, and your abode is prepared for company.</P>

<P>Your breathing is ragged, with a disturbing rhythm. Your
device states that you should seek your medication and
lets you know that it is contacting the doctor with your
present location.</P>

<P>That creaking in your bones causes your electronic
companion to advise you to slow down your activity and
possibly seek help.
<BR></P>


<P>Other "mobile" applications:</P>

<P>Your car is acting up. The device samples the sound so
that you can replay it for the mechanic.</P>

<P>Your vehicle's handling has degraded. Based on the sounds,
your device soothingly remarks: "Don't worry. The road is
being repaved, and there's nothing wrong with your car."</P>

<P>You're feeling  unsafe in the parking lot. You vocalize
"Protect me," and your vehicle starts up, blares the horn,
and if you have one of those South African carjacker
deterrents, it ignites the flamethrowers.</P>

<P>The possiblities are truly endless. Good luck in your
endeavors to sort out the best entries!</P>

<P>OK. Here's my entry. Imagine it stuck to the dashboard of
a car, or inset like a radio. The dashboard-radio model
can hook into the car's audio system (and might even be
the radio/cd-player/mp3-player), while the external model
can have its own speaker.</P>

<P>When someone in the car (the driver, presumably) says,
"Pray for me," that's exactly what it does.</P>

<P>Of course, you might want different models to say
different things; a good popular version might recite
Psalm 23 ("The Lord is my shepherd...") though certainly
other religious traditions will want it to say something
else. Cynical hipster types might want their in-dash
prayer boxes to recite William S. Burroughs' Thanksgiving
Prayer ('Thanks for Indians, to provide a modicum of
challenge and danger... thanks for a nation of finks...'
etc.) and some guilty white liberals (some Viridians,
even) might want theirs to apologize for driving around in
a vehicle spewing noxious fumes into the atmosphere.</P>

<P>The internal and external models each have advantages: the
ability of the in-dash model to hook into the car's audio
system, so that it can pray loud enough for other people
to hear, is pretty nice. But the external model can be
shaped; Christians could have cross-shaped prayer boxes,
Muslims could have Crescent moons, Jews could have the
star of David, various Hindu versions can have different
gods on theirs and so on. These would probably be light
enough to be strapped to a bicycle in other parts of the
world.</P>

<P>Strangest of all is the 'silent prayer' version, which
copies the audio and sends it to the audio chip, but cuts
it off between there and the speaker.</P>

The solar-powered grid imbedded in the rear window of my
hybrid Toyota Prius flashes "50 miles per gallon" when I
say "Annoy SUVs".  This concept, of course, could be
expanded so the rear window has a robust vocabulary,
perhaps even being multi-lingual, and could possibly cut
down on road rage incidents, as people now could just
insult each other via their windows.</P>

<P>When I say "Litter box, clean yourself", the robotic cat
litter box wheels itself outside, then using the
telescopic legs, empties itself in the garbage can, stops
on the way back to clean itself with a garden hose, then,
just prior to returning to its base, fills itself with the
proper amount of cat litter.</P>

"Feet don't fail me now" while backpacking up a steep
grade with a heavy backpack will activate a special
bouncing mechanism in ones' hiking boots, giving that
needed extra boost to climb the final pitch. Warning: This
technology will be met with suspicion by traditionalist
backpackers, and will no doubt, lead to deep rifts in the
mountaineering world.</P>

  I want to know where my dog (or cat) is right now, so
  I have a  talking food dish.  I ask it "where's Cleo?" and

  capable of storing ten hours of spoken dialogue.  It would
  be triggered whenever anyone said my name in conversation,
  weeding out background noise.  It would also be triggered
  when I said a keyphrase.  So if my boss said "Hey Warren!"
  it would kick in, but if he didn't I would say "hey there,
  how's it going?" or "what's up, amigo?" and it would start

<P>My first entry in the Viridian Neologue Contest:  the Tree
of  Knowledge (aka Project Ent, aka Johnny Appleseed v2.0,
aka the Philosotree.)</P>

<P>Sensors subtly embedded in a tree trunk would respond to
verbal cues.  These  could be very simple == "wisdom," for
example == or more specific:  say, the name of a poet or
philosopher.  These would activate the playback of a
corresponding sound file, stored upon hardware inside or
even underneath the bole.  Not in a tinny, overtly
synthetic way, but using the finest audio components
available, with speakers perhaps distributed throughout
the canopy; and not a few canned seconds, but entire
canons.</P>

<P>Granted, this mayJseem to be rooted (ha) in the talking
Coke machine or seat-belt matron.  However, future
advances in wireless transmission, voice recognition, data
storage, AI, bioengineering, and even robotics make
enormous the potential for refinement and evolution.</P>

<P>(Here my imagination, always characterized by the
excessive, kicks into overdrive.  Part tree, part code,
given consciousness and the ability to  recreate itself==
but always in sapling form, clone of the previous; nature
v.s. nurture, subtle variations increasing exponentially
unil the far range  of diversity at which point?--twenty-
first centure Johnny Appleseeds, planting these
intelligent trees which (x) has forbidden--symbiotic
relationships with creatures bred/engineered/coded to live
within the the  tree--dryads, sylphs given reality--)</P>


<P>Project Ent is particularly satisfying in its synthesis of
organic and artificial within the human-engineered
environment.</P>

<P>Ideally, the tree would grow around/with its synthetic
components.  However,  I'm sure the wonks at NYU could
find a way to rig up a tree.  A Joshua tree,  perhaps,
even just a pedestrian oak or maple.
