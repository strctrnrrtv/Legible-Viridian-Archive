and what a gratifying gush of data we have to show today.
I confess I'm slightly disappointed to learn that Western
Fuels Corp/Greening Earth and the Global Climate Coalition
are merely tangentially involved in "Balanced Power,"
rather than actually just plain <STRONG>being</STRONG> "Balanced Power."
But we'll keep looking for further incarnations of these

<P>Hi Bruce,</P>

<P>The domain balancedenergy.org is owned by CEED, the Center
for Energy and Economic Development
(<A HREF="http://www.ceednet.org">http://www.ceednet.org</A>), which lists Western Fuels on
their Board of Directors. Western Fuels in turn are listed
as owning the domain greeningearthsociety.org.</P>

<P>Incidentally westernfuels.org and ceednet.org are both
hosted by the same ISP, although this might just be a
coincidence.  It all looks very cosy though.</P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>"Dear Bruce == Your buddies from "Balanced Energy" seem to
be joined at the hip with CEED.  The "position paper" at
<A HREF="http://www.balancedenergy.org/culprit.htm">http://www.balancedenergy.org/culprit.htm</A>, entitled "The
Culprits Behind Those Shocking Electricity Prices" is by
one Linda Stuntz, who has published a number of similar
screeds at the CEED site.  In fact, the two sites share
significant genetic code, including the topic headings
"Essential" "Affordable", and my favorite == "Increasingly
Clean."  They also seem to have exactly the same groovy
little state map telling you how much you pay in your
state for electricity, and why.</P>

<P>This site:
<A HREF="http://www.ceednet.org/about_ceed/leadership.htm">http://www.ceednet.org/about_ceed/leadership.htm</A></P>


<P>reveals the following guys:</P>

<P>Charles McCrary, President of Generation for Southern
Company, serves as the Chairman of CEED's Board of
Directors; and Steven Leer, President and CEO of Arch
Coal, Inc., serves as Vice Chairmen.</P>

<P>Stephen L. Miller serves as CEED's President and CEO. He
directs the CEED staff, which is comprised of 15 full-time
employees, and oversees an annual budget of $5 million.
CEED's National Office is located in Alexandria, Virginia,
and four regional offices are located in New Jersey,
Missouri, Texas, and Colorado.</P>

<P>Perhaps a Viridian greenhouse denial org chart/genealogy
would be in order.  I'm having a little trouble following
all the players here.  (((An excellent suggestion, Highly
Place Source!  I sense a Viridian Design Contest coming
up!)))</P>

<P>I will try to do a little follow-up, but this morning, I
have to go sue some polluters.</P>

<P><U>(((Good luck!  Always good to hear from you!)))</U><BR></P>

<P>(((And now, a spectacular plethora of info from the
hard-working Carol A. Bourgeois
(cbourgeo@TXFUND.COM^^^^^^^**)</P>

<P>Here's a leadership nexus.  The Center for Energy and
Economic Development quoted CEED President Steve Miller in
an article dissing studies supporting global warming and
cautioning against adoption of Kyoto protocols:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.ceednet.org/newsletter/v7n3.htm">http://www.ceednet.org/newsletter/v7n3.htm</A>
<BR></P>

<P>"We caution policymakers to fully examine the evidence
available regarding climate change and global climate
modeling," said Steve Miller, CEED's President. "They will
discover that these computer models have inherent flaws,
and can neither explain the disparity between surface and
lower  atmospheric temperatures, nor can they predict
long-term  climate change based on short-term weather
patterns. Indeed, many scientists maintain that GHG
emissions from electric power plants are not contributing
significantly to overall warming  trends. Natural
phenomena and other causes should not be ignored."</P>

<P>(((It's predictable yet interesting to learn that
"Americans for Balanced Energy Choices" are not merely
"pro-choice" on coal issues, but also climate denial
freaks under another name.)))</P>

<P>The fact that CEED's national office is in Alexandria
would come as no surprise, either.  Note that the Chairman
of the Board of CEED is a big wheel in the Southern
Company.  That would be the ever expanding, monopolistic
Southern Company, as in "Southern Union Gas."</P>


<P>(((In other words, we Texans here in the territory of
Southern Union Gas are underwriting Balanced Power's ad
budget whenever we pay a gas bill.  Ever wonder where they
got enough money to go head-to-head with BP in the
corporate-green wars?  Simple!  They got that money from
you!)))</P>

<P><BR>
Steve L. Miller, the President of the CEED/ABEC nexus, has
worked for Union Gas Emerging Markets division.  This link
discusses the global warming trend:</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.uniongas.com/newsletters/connects/mar2000/warmfall.html">http://www.uniongas.com/newsletters/connects/mar2000/warmfall.html</A>
<BR></P>

<P>You see, petroleum products expand during very hot
weather.  They require more storage volume, resulting in
reduced product delivery.  Therefore, global warming hits
the energy suppliers/shippers right in the pocketbook.  So
in their actual operations, they are forced to acknowledge
global warming, though in an unhelpful way.</P>

<P>(((As a final gift, Carol Bourgeois sends us this helpful
article from a Texan muckraking political journal, the
Texas Observer.  Here we see CEED/ABEC at work, a
wonderful insight into the everyday world of corporate
spin.)))</P>

<P>"Find Another Farmer
<BR></P>

<P>"If you watch TV or read glossy magazines, sometime
this month you'll probably see a commercial featuring a
smiling farmer (joined by a slew of barbers, soccer moms,
and other denizens of Main Street America) sharing his
thoughts about coal.
<BR></P>

<P>"His warm, fuzzy, good thoughts. It won't be a real
farmer, of course == it'll be an actor. And it won't be
this actor, Austinite Brady Coleman. Coleman, known for
his film work (he was the sheriff in "What's Eating
Gilbert Grape") and his commercials (in which he usually
plays an amiable Texan), was the man Coal wanted for the
part. But Coleman didn't want Coal.
<BR></P>

<P>"'I was really busy that day and my agent told me
to go in and read for a commercial,' Coleman said. The
title of the spot was 'Americans for Balanced Energy
Choices == no mention of coal. "I didn't pay that much
attention to it, you know == it could have been solar or
wind or something,' said Coleman, who has been a member of
the Sierra Club for thirty years. 'Two or three days later
my agent calls me and says, 'You got the part.'
<BR></P>

<P>"Still not having seen the ad's script, he started to
get a little suspicious about just who these Americans
were. 'My agent really didn't know ... and the casting
director didn't know == she was just doing her job.' So
Coleman called the production company, who finally told
him what he'd be hawking: coal.
<BR></P>

<P>"'I uncasted myself,' Coleman said.  Coleman got in
touch with a Sierra Club official in Texas, who had never
heard of the Americans for Balanced Energy Choices. After
talking to Coleman, Left Field began calling the usual
suspects.
<BR></P>

<P>"The Greening Earth Society (the Washington non-profit
that promotes the beneficial aspects of global warming)
couldn't help us, but the Society's receptionist did save
us a phone call to the Western Fuels Association (the
giant Rocky Mountain strip-mining outfit) that was next on
our list.</P>

<P>(((You see, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not making this
stuff up.  If you punch just one layer down to what's
actually happening, it's dead obvious to everybody.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"'Ned's at lunch right now,' he said. Apparently the two
groups share an office in D.C. Go figure.  (((They don't
"share an office," for heaven's sake.  They're the same
operation.  More to the point, "Greening Earth" and
"Western Fuels" are the same <STRONG>guy</STRONG> == Fred Palmer.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Next we tried the Center for Energy and Economic
Development, another coal industry front group, where we
finally got the response we were looking for. 'It is a
registered non-profit,' spokesman Joe Lucas said. Coal
related? 'I do not have an answer for that at this time.'
<BR></P>

<P>"Two hours later Lucas called back: "[Americans for
Balanced Energy Choices] is a national non-profit whose
mission is to promote a national dialogue with community
leaders about the growing demand for electricity and about
preserving the proper balance between the environment and
continued growth.'  (((Good luck fitting that on a T-
shirt.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Lucas confirmed that the primary sponsors are coal
producers, railroads, and electric utilities. He denied
that any specific issue == such as the controversial
practice of mountaintop removal mining currently being
debated in Congress == was behind the timing of the coming
ad blitz. But the blitz is coming.
<BR></P>

<P>"'You'll be hearing a whole lot more in the weeks
ahead,' he said.  Back in Austin, meanwhile, there is one
less casting director Brady Coleman will be working with.
'She was extremely pissed off. Because the time to do that
[back out] is before you even audition. But it was just so
innocuous sounding,' Coleman said. 'I mean if it had been
hemorrhoids or tobacco or Bush or something I would have
just said no straight off.'"</P>

<P>Bruce,</P>

<P>I was curious what I could dig up on BE, so I researched
their tracks on the 'net.  Their domain's registered to:</P>

<P>CEED
1800 Diagonal Road, Suite 370
Alexandria, VA 22314</P>

<P>This is the same address as the CEED or Center for Energy
and Economic Development at &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ceednet.org">http://www.ceednet.org</A>&gt; on
the web. They also list the same phone and fax.  Their
domain was create on 13 March of this year.</P>

<P>(((Merely March 13, huh?  Any bets on how long this
phantom stays in business?  I'm betting they shut down
pronto after the USA's November 02000 elections, but that
could just be me and my uncharitable suspicions.)))</P>

<P>CEED is very nice about listing their history at
<A HREF="http://www.ceednet.org/about_ceed/history.htm">http://www.ceednet.org/about_ceed/history.htm</A></P>

<P>and their membership at
<A HREF="http://www.ceednet.org/about_ceed/membership_information.htm">http://www.ceednet.org/about_ceed/membership_information.htm</A>
<BR></P>

<P>On that latter page there are links to lists of CEED's
contributing and associate members.
<BR></P>

<P>I don't know what kind of server they're running. The
machine appears to be in Interland's Atlanta data center.
Their site shows hallmarks of being developed on Windows
by people  more comfortable with Windows than UNIX.
<BR></P>

<P>The site looks reasonably competent.  I don't the
silly mistakes of the novice.  That just means they put
some funding behind it.  Besides their webserver, they're
running mail, ftp, secure mail, and secure web servers.
<BR></P>

<P>The upshot is that CEED/ABEC is an organization of
companies devoted to mining, shipping, and using coal.
Not big Kyoto supporters.  But, I think we guessed that
already.</P>

launching a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign aimed

tradition of deceptively-named industry front groups

organizations as simple as writing a check") the new group
is called Americans for Balanced Energy Choices.
