PlaNetwork Speech by Bruce Sterling
Presidio, San Francisco, May 12, 02000
<P>
<P>
Hi, glad to be here.  Thanks for that fulsome
introduction.  Let me  start with a little audience
participation here.  We've got a pretty good crowd here, a
very <strong>variegated</strong> crowd.  I'd like to have a show of hands
among you.  Before that introduction by Erik Davis, who
out there had absolutely no idea who I was?   You never
heard of me.  I'm a complete stranger to you, we're
meeting here completely by accident, apparently.  Thank
you for you frankness, ladies and gentlemen.  That was
very enlightening.
<P>
<P>
Okay, fine.  My name's Bruce Sterling, I'm from
Austin Texas, I'm a futurist and I write novels.    I'm
pleased to be here, it's a lovely venue and a nice event,
and I'm looking forward to hearing what other attendees
and presenters have to say.  There's obviously a lot of
territory to cover.  Tonight, however,  I'm going to
confine my remarks to a single environmental incident.
<P>
<P>
As has been said many times before,  "The future is
already here, it's just not well distributed yet."  In my
business as a journalist and science fiction writer, I
collect harbingers.  Got stacks full of harbingers.   I
live for this activity.  Some harbingers are more striking
than others.   My speech today will concern just one of
them.
<P>
<P>
Let me, if I may,  call your attention to recent
events in Los Alamos.  Ladies and gentleman, thanks to a
prolonged La Nina drought and anomalous high winds, the
capital of the American atomic intelligentsia is on fire.
In fact, I flew over Los Alamos this morning, on my way
here.  It was quite a sight.
<P>
<P>
The burning of Los Alamos is an event, I believe, that
should strongly resonate with people in the Green
community.  An event like PlaNetwork, which I take to be
the first gathering of a strange new tribe of the high-
tech Cybergreen community, should pay especial attention
to this.  Because this is not a merely common-or-garden
massive environmental disaster, such as Mozambique being
flooded by repeated giant tempests,  or Honduras
submerging in a colossal mudslide.  This is the American
scientific intelligentsia, on fire.  Los Alamos, the
company town of the Manhattan Project, is burning out of
control.  I regard this event as a kind of dark salute to
us and our concerns.
<P>
<P>
You may ask yourself: why did this unhappy fire
start?  Well, the simple answer is that it was started by
federal officials.  The Park Service was attempting to
manage that bone-dry underbrush, to set some cautious,
farsighted, instrumental, federally-approved backfires,
before the real hell broke loose.   They knew very well
that wildfire  was coming.  This winter's drought in New
Mexico has been among the worst the state has ever seen.
<P>
<P>
But these farsighted attempts to engineer Nature do
have their operational difficulties.  Now despite the
recent outcry in Congress and the press, I don't believe
these Park Service people did anything gravely wrong or
unusual.   The people setting those backfires expected the
heat to go down at night.   The heat usually does.
Unfortunately, since the planet Earth has been setting
heat records for sixteen straight months, the heat does
not go down at night in the customary way that it used to
do.  The night stayed hot, so the fires burned hot.  The
feds also expected the winds to die down at evening, as
well.   The wind commonly does die down.  This time the
wind did not die down. Instead, the wind got worse.
Therefore, a backfire, meant to avert a scourge, has
become a scourge.   Why should we blame our public
servants?  A Republican Senator has loudly ordered a
federal investigation, but come on, it's a natural
disaster.  The weather is supposed to be one of those
things.
<P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this weather disaster is not merely
natural.  Because that is no longer Nature that the
federal land service is attempting to engineer in New
Mexico.   Mother Nature is not behaving by the federal
rule book any more, she has thrown that book away.
Nature ended in New Mexico about the time that Bill
McKibben wrote his book, THE END OF NATURE.   So that's
not a natural disaster.  That is a brand-new,  twenty-
first-century-style,  Greenhouse disaster.
<P>
<P>
Now imagine if this were happening in Indonesia,
instead of New Mexico.  A terrible drought, no rain in the
rain forest, poor people slashing-and-burning in the
forest.  Fire spreads out of control.  Capital choked in
smoke for weeks on end.  What would we say?  Well,
"Greenhouse Effect."  It's Indonesia, the jungle's on
fire, what can you do.
<P>
<P>
Well, isn't this Indonesia's planet?  Does the
weather stop at Immigration?  Of course this is
Indonesia's planet!  This  isn't Planet America.
Our continent's on the same planet as theirs.
We just have more cameras here.  And a
different set of scapegoats.
<P>
<P>
Since I am a novelist rather than a meteorologist,
I'n not going to talk about El Nino and isobars.  I could
do that, if I wanted to see your eyes glaze over, but I
don't, so I won't.  Instead, I want to try to get you to
poetically apprehend this situation.  Bill McKibben might
do a good job of this for us, but as far as I know, he's
not around.  The last I saw of Bill McKibben, he was on C-
SPAN, being arrested in the rotunda of the US Senate.
They led Bill McKibben off in plastic handcuffs:  he was
loudly protesting about the Greenhouse Effect and the
intolerable corruption in American campaign finance.   So
let's just put Mr. McKibben aside for the moment.   He's
just another articulate intellectual like the rest of us.
<P>
<P>
Let me concentrate entirely on the situation on the
ground.   This is Los Alamos, the legendary birthplace of
atomic power.  But that's not a mushroom cloud that's
hanging over their skies.  That is a carbon-dioxide
combustion cloud.   Mighty big, though.  Saw it today.
Four hundred homes burned so far, plume of smoke three
hundred miles long and visible from space. The entire city
has been evacuated.  That sort of thing.
<P>
<P>
There is, however, some reassuring news from the
authorities.  We are informed that the nuclear materials,
and lo there are many in Los Alamos, are safe inside
fireproof vaults.   A blazing grass fire swept past the
weapons-engineering tritium facility at Technical Area 16
yesterday, but it's a nice solid masonry building, so it's
just a little scorched.   Therefore, I think I can promise
you that nuclear material will not be carried in the
fierce updraft from an out-of control urban firestorm, and
then liberally sifted, just as if it were fallout, in the
wake downstream from a burning federal laboratory.  That
has not happened.  That is science fiction, I made that
part up.  There are federal contingency plans.   We're
told it's not a matter of concern.   Let me ask your
opinion on something.   If the plans went wrong, and that
did actually happen, do you think that we might be allowed
to panic?
<P>
<P>
Let me ask you something further.  Why is the most
prestigious laboratory of the Department of Energy on
fire?
<P>
<P>
I don't want to heap unnecessary embers of sarcasm on
Los Alamos.  They may be engaged in destroying the planet,
but so what, we all are.   I'm sure that any online
marketeer could tell you that their zipcode in Los Alamos
and my zipcode in Austin have many, many overlapping
consumption patterns, like Palm Pilots, blue corn
tortillas, top-shelf tequila margaritas and subscriptions
to SMITHSONIAN.  I feel some sense of identity with them.
In case you haven't looked lately, Los Alamos National
Laboratory is remarkably  cyber-green.   They have a green
chemistry program there.  They do global hydromodelling
and lightning studies on supercomputers.    They do waste
remediation.   For you cypherpunks out there, they even do
quantum cryptography.   These are some of the brightest
and most capable people in the world.
<P>
<P>
Los Alamos National Lab even has climate models.  For
instance, Los Alamos has a supercomputer model that can
simulate wildfires.  Los Alamos has the only software on
earth that can run realistic, three-dimensional wildfire
simulations, on a fine scale.   The lab is deserted now
because of the emergency evacuations,  but if anybody was
allowed inside the lab and could boot up their heavy iron,
they'd be able to model what is happening to them right
now.
<P>
<P>
Los Alamos is owned by the Department of Energy.
The  Department of Energy is in charge of America's energy
policy, or the mess we have that passes for one.  So these
are exquisitely-qualified technical experts.  They are in
a splendid position to assess nuclear energy, and fossil-
fuel energy, and their various effects in the world.
They must step outside the lab sometimes.  They can read a
thermometer.  They must know that the world is getting
hotter.   That the weather is getting rambunctious.
They're technically literate people.  How could they not
know that?  Now they are on fire.
<P>
<P>
It's no great atomic super-secret that the sky is
full of carbon dioxide.  You can measure it with an
instrument.    The soot  is getting thicker, and the
climate is getting weirder.   It's on CNN, it's in TIME
magazine.  Oil companies admit this.  Car companies admit
this.   The Energy Department's intelligentsia is now on
fire.  Log on and look at their website.  I might point
out to you web-design fans in the audience that the Los
Alamos lab website has a lovely piece of Java-style
dancing baloney in it, a little digital wildfire.  "Do not
try to come to the Laboratory!" this website declares, in
Times New Roman font, 24 points, bold.
<P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, I guess we should all admit
that Los Alamos has disappointed us before.   America's
weapons designers never managed to give us a nuclear
Armageddon.  They were certainly lavishly financed, and
they always claimed they were ready to launch at a
moment's notice,  but somehow they never launched.   World
War II turned out to be our only nuclear war, and the
number-one product in Los Alamos was always vaporware.
So now they are themselves on fire, and unfortunately for
them, and their families, and their parks, and their
gardens, and their forests, and their schools, a
Greenhouse disaster is not the vaporware part.   They
built machines that can incinerate cities at the push of a
button.  Now their city is on fire and they can do nothing
to redress this.   They cannot rise to this  occasion.
They cannot even frankly describe or constructively
confront this national security threat.  They are reduced
to utter, squalid impotence.
<P>
<P>
It grieves me to tell you that these gifted people,
so lavishly underwritten for so many decades, are not only
useless, but victims themselves.  Even after the headlines
from this fire fade, and they're on their hands and knees
sifting through the ashes of their own homes for unburned
bits of their children's toys, they won't utter a peep of
protest about the true cause of their sorrow.    They
depend on Congressional funding to earn a living.  The
United States Congress is run by no-neck Christian
fundamentalists who sell insecticide and teach high-school
wrestling.  The Senate is in the hands of the coal and oil
interests.  They dare not cross the Senate, so they won't
speak out even when their own homes burn.  The Senate
wouldn't do anything useful anyway.  They're not going to
pass the Kyoto Accords, no matter what scientists may say.
This Senate is so far behind the curve that they can't
even get it together to pass a nuclear arms accord.  So
no, Los Alamos won't say or do anything.  I think the
scientists in Los Alamos can still be trusted to keep the
nuclear omerta.  Even if Republican investigators think
otherwise of them.
<P>
<P>
The lesson here is not that atomic scientists are
gutless eggheads.  Einstein and Sakharov weren't gutless:
these people are colleagues of Einstein and Sakharov.
The true lesson of Los Alamos is that there's no ivory
tower to hide in.  You can have the biggest supercomputers
on earth and a broadband video feed.  If a Greenhouse
monsoon rolls in, you're gonna have live video feed of
your supercomputers washing downriver.
<P>
<P>
What are you gonna do when the sky turns black over
your town?  Are you gonna jump inside your laptop screen?
Where you gonna hide, console cowboy?  If it gets hotter,
you can click up the AC like we do in Texas, but the
Greenhouse Effect is an extremely intimate disaster.
You're breathing it right now.   The planet's entire
atmosphere from pole to pole has been soiled with effluent
from smokestacks.  Too much carbon dioxide.  It's in every
single breath you take, it fills this very room.   You
don't get to pick and choose.  There's no pull-down menu
for another atmosphere.   The sky is full of soot.
Everywhere.  There's soot in Yosemite.  There's soot at
the source of the Nile.  There's soot in Walden Pond and
soot in the Serengeti. There is no refuge.  It's not
imaginary, it's here.
<P>
<P>
Yet it's nothing compared to what is coming. Whatever
sins of omission and comission we may have committed
environmentally, they are the small ones, they are the
beginner steps.  Look at the curves, do some of the math.
We're in deep already, but these are just harbingers.  The
real trouble lies ahead.
<P>
<P>
This situation calls for the genius of a Einstein
and the moral commitment of a Sakharov.  Unfortunately,
the colleagues of Einstein and Sakharov are packing their
car trunks and wheezing.   Robert Oppenheimer isn't here.
Vannevar Bush isn't here. They are all dead.  Their
century is over. We are here.  Planetworking people.  We
are here, and I don't even know how to describe us. This
meeting does have its comic side, ladies and gentlemen.
Take some New Age hipster guru in a Guatemalan yarn vest.
Add the crackpot inventor from the Disney version of
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."   Shake well and ship to San
Francisco.  That is us.
<P>
<P>
In fact, that is me. I am having a moment of
passionate identification here.  I'm not claiming I'm any
great shakes, but I do feel strongly that I actually
belong here among you.  I don't claim I can do anything
useful, or productive, or practical about the future.  I
am a wacky cyberpunk visionary.  I only want you to
believe one thing about the future: I can smell it.   So
who would imagine that a motley crowd of geeks and
dissidents are  people who might rise to this grave
occasion?
<P>
<P>
Okay, admittedly, it's a long shot.  But imagine that
we were those people. <b>Green geeks.</b>  Imagine there really
wasn't much else around.  Imagine that the Christian right
and the hippie left were still thumbwrestling in some
senile culture war.  Suppose that the government's knees
were still shaking from a ludicrous coup d'etat blowjob.
Imagine that giant worldwide smokestack industries were
huge, rich, ruthless, stupid and corrupt.  Suppose that
science was mute, and the population was sleepwalking
through the fire, while spin doctors ruled the earth.
Suppose that people like us were in fact the big bright
spot.  The silver lining on the Greenhouse cloud, as it
were.  Imagine that we were exactly the kind of people who
might somehow find new approaches, accomplish something
practical and actually change this.  I'm not saying that
we're those people right now.  But imagine that we became
those people.
<P>
<P>
I thought I ought to raise that possibility.  Thanks!
