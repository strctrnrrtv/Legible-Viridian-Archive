"Consequences of Changing Biodiversity" by F. Chapin, E.
Zevaleta, V. Eviner, et.al
<P>
"Finally, the mobility of people has transported
organisms across the geographical barriers that long kept
the biotic regions of the Earth separated, so that many
ecologically important plant and animal species of many
areas have been introduced in historic time."
<P>
<P>
(...)  "The introduction of the nitrogen-fixing tree
<b>Myrica faya</b> to nitrogen-limited ecosystems in Hawaii led
to a fivefold increase in nitrogen inputs to the
ecosystem, which in turn changed most of the functional
and structural properties of native forests.
<P>
<P>
"Introduction of the deep-rooted salt cedar (<b>Tamarix
sp.</b>) to the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of North America
increased the water and soil solutes accessed by
vegetation, enhanced productivity, and increased surface
litter and salts.  This inhibited the regeneration of many
native species, leading to a general reduction in
biodiversity.
<P>
<P>
"The perennial tussock grass, <b>Agropyron cristatum,</b>
which was widely introduced to the northern Great Plains
of North America after the 1930s 'dustbowl,' has
substantially lower allocation to roots compared with
native prairie grasses.  Soil under <b>A. cristatum</b> has
lower levels of available nitrogen and ~25% less total
carbon than native prairie soil, so the introduction of
this species resulted in an equivalent reduction of 480 X
10 (12) g of carbon stored in soils."  (((This gloomy
analysis makes one wonder what kind of grass stores the
<strong>most</strong> carbon in soils.  Why don't we plant our lawns in
that stuff?)))
<P>
<P>
(...)  "Several species of nutritious but flammable
grasses were introduced to the Hawaiian Islands to support
cattle grazing.  Some of these grasses spread into
protected woodlands, where they caused a 300-fold increase
in the the extent of fire.  (((An amazing statistic.  Cro-
Magnons with torches may have been the best friends that
the world's prairies ever had.)))  "Most of the woody
plants, including some endangered species, are eliminated
by fire, whereas grasses rebound quickly.
<P>
<P>
"Similar increases in the ecological role of fire
resulting from grass invasions have been widely observed
in the Americas, Australia and elsewhere in Oceania.  The
invasion of cheatgrass (<b>Bromus tectorum</b>) into western
North America is one of the msot extensive of these
invasions.  Cheatgrass has increased fire frequency by a
factor of more than ten in the &gt;40 million hectares that
it now dominates. (...)
<P>
<P>
(((Now for a truly weird speculation.)))  "At the
regional scale, an improvement in hunting technology at
the end of the Pleistocene may have contributed to the
loss of the Pleistocene megafauna and the widespread
change from steppe grassland to tundra that occurred in
Siberia 10,000 to 18,000 years ago.  The resulting
increase in mosses insulated the soil and led to cooler
soils, less decomposition and greater sequestration of
carbon in peat."  (((In other words, remove the mammoths
and permafrost sets in.)))
<P>
<P>
(...)  "Large populations of passenger pigeons
(<b>Ectopistes migratorius</b>) in the northeastern United
States may have controlled Lyme tick-bearing mice by out-
competing them for food.  The loss of the passenger pigeon
to nineteenth-century over-hunting may, therefore, have
contributed to the rise of Lyme disease in humans in the
twentieth century."
