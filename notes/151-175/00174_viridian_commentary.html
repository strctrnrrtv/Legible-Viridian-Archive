<P>Howdy Pope.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoyed your thoughts on Long Now &amp; time capsules. The
world also has involuntary time capsules. "Involuntary
parks" like  Chernobyl preserve endangered species in a
world that sees biodiversity  vanish at an ever-faster
pace.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are landmines and unexploded ordnance.
These artifacts are buried in the ground for future
exposure. They say  negative things about us and our
society, and will continue to threaten  people for decades
if not hundreds of years.  Yet while they're
stylistically inappropriate, they may serve to help
protect forests (and  their inhabitants) from rampant
logging in Southeast Asia.  Future generations may refer
to Chernobyl, Cambodia and Mozambique as  'fortunate
accidents'.</P>

<P>Your remarks about the Eiffel Tower reminded me of my
recent trip to Brussels.  My hotel was not far from the
"Atomium," a monument built for the 1958 Worlds Fair.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Atomium, if you haven't seen it, is a 400 foot
high model of an iron atom. (The exhibit was funded by the
metals industry.) If you want to see a picture, there's
one on the web page, at <A HREF="http://www.atomium.be/">http://www.atomium.be/</A> . The
Atomium is a whole bunch of gleaming metal spheres
connected by gleaming metal rods, just like those little
atom models you had in chemistry class, but much, much
bigger. You can go inside of it, all the way up to the
top, and (if the haze and smog permit) see much of
Brussels from the air, as with many other tall-building
tourist attractions.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really made the Atomium special, though, was the
sensibility of 1958, the whole "The atom is our future!"
vibe the place has. (As we approached, my wife whispered
the phrase "Raygun Gothic!") Originally, escalators ran
between the rods, and some still remain.  It's still easy
to imagine the fair, and the Atomium at its heyday.  In a
brilliant postmodern move, most of the public exhibit
space is now dedicated to comic books that feature the
Atomium.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps there's space in the Viridian movement for
admiration of failed anti-Viridian belief systems. Like
the badly decayed 'atomic rocket car' motif. Sure, we're
subject to the same foibles as all of these people == if
not worse follies == but a four hundred foot high iron
atom was one heck of a rhetorical gesture.  There's a
whole aesthetic in the failure of attempted permanency.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about flipping your concept of the radiactive
clock?  Instead of killing you if you get too close, you
die if you move far away.   The perimeter charnel house
would create a quick myth and a horocentric society.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Suzuki's new book  has a lovely passage about
the gas Argon, which is not  assimilated by living beings.
Therefore "your next breath will  contain about 400,000 of
the argon atoms that Gandhi breathed in his  life. Argon
atoms are here from the conversations at the last supper,
from the arguments of diplomats at Yalta, and from the
recitations of  the classic poets...". This makes me
wonder if we shouldn't somehow power a clock  with
expelled argon.</P>

<P>In thousands of years, no one will understand us moderns.
A serious Long Now effort should start with "what will
they be able to decode in 10K years", and work backwards
from there.  I'd suggest  a few hundred geographically-
distributed gizmos that look like the Mayan/Aztec calendar
stone, tallying every sunrise and sunset, powered by
decaying chunks of spent U238.</P>

<P>(((This is not at all far from the Long Now Foundation's
"Rosetta Disk" concept.  It's a micro-etched metal disk
with a steel container and a lens top, containing brief
excerpts of a thousand contemporary languages.  Though it
says little itself, like the Rosetta Stone, it should
enable the decipherment of any contemporary wreckage still
hanging around centuries later.)))</P>
