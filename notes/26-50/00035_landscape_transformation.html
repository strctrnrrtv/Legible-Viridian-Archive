      <p>Bruce Sterling remarks: </p>
      <p>Andy Goldsworthy is an artist well worth our attention. How might his 
        approach be furthered and extended in the century to come? </p>
      <p>It might be argued that there is not much room for development there. 
        After all, Goldsworthy has been working for two decades now. He obviously 
        has firm ideas about what he is doing, but he seems to lack disciples. 
        Does the world require more than one artist who wants to place wet flower 
        petals on rocks? Would it even be possible to make dozens of art careers 
        out of coloring tide pools green, or pinning fallen leaves together with 
        thorns? Perhaps Goldsworthy is necessarily unique, a sui generis artist 
        such as Cindy Sherman, who has a well-deserved hammerlock on dressing 
        herself up as a movie still. </p>
      <p>Or maybe not. Maybe the core Viridian issue here is not art photography, 
        but the transformation of landscape. Viridians want a new and different 
        appreciation of the biosphere and its processes and potentials; a new 
        way to put hand to earth. </p>
      <p>Imagine future artists having the hand-to-earth sensibility of Andy Goldsworthy, 
        but extending it into other realms of practice. </p>
      <p>A. Artificial life studies and digital "ecosystems." This is almost too 
        obvious. One might note the uncanny resemblance between Goldsworthy압 
        leaf cornucopias and the spiral "ghost sculptures" of computer artist 
        William Latham. </p>
      <p>B. Gardening, park design, and plant breeding. Could you plant a landscape 
        that would grow year by year to affect the viewer in the way that a Goldsworthy 
        photograph does? Perhaps you앇 have to genetically alter the character 
        of the plants. If you can change plant genetics on fast- forward and at 
        will, does this make Luther Burbank a sculptor? If "a rose is no longer 
        a rose," then how does one properly introduce genetically transformed 
        vegetation into a natural landscape? Just how different can a rose look 
        and still be beautiful? Keep in mind that many landscapes we consider 
        pastoral today are full of alien species from distant continents. In the 
        USA this includes such "natural" icons as the mustang horse and the tumbleweed. 
      </p>
      <p>C. Vary the scale. How small could you make this art? Could you do it 
        with a single plant? With a single leaf? With mold and pollen? With bacteria? 
        With chromosomes? Could you create a legitimate "garden" on a microscopically 
        etched silicon landscape? After all, if it압 the art photography that 
        counts, why not art photomicrography? </p>
      <p>D. How big could it be? Suppose you were given a giant abandoned strip 
        mine and told to rebuild it from dead bedrock. Not as some desperate act 
        of reclamation, but as a neo-biological art project. It could never look 
        "natural." It has to look "something else." It also has to thrive, it 
        has to be beautiful, it has to work. <i>What</i> is the "something else?" 
        How do you judge it as artwork? </p>
      <p>E. The traditional half-way house between city and wilderness is the 
        farm, the park, the garden -- but Andy Goldsworthy isn앖 a gardener or 
        suburban planner, he압 a performance artist. Suppose you had never heard 
        of agriculture, but you had unheard-of genetic and biological transformative 
        powers. What does a bio/post/industrial landscape look like when you put 
        the profit motive aside, and push the new medium for its own sake? </p>
      <p>F. Goldsworthy doesn앖 use unnatural objects in his nature studies. But 
        it can be done. For instance, people frequently build offshore reef shelters 
        by sinking dead ships and dead cars. Imagine building a Goldworthy landscape 
        that contained (for instance) a wrecked internal combustion engine. Is 
        there an <i>aesthetic</i> of ruined and abandoned technological enterprises 
        returning to "nature"? Is there a realm of beauty where nature is <i>thriving</i> 
        by devouring abandoned human creations? Not a ruin returning to jungle, 
        not weeds thriving downwind of Chernobyl -- a place of genuine fulfillment. 
        Of happiness. A place where this process benefits us. Where it is for 
        our own good. Where we prefer it that way. </p>
      <p>G. Goldworthy likes to document process and decay. Change the temporal 
        scale. Can you accelerate this process, or retard it? How about a five 
        or fifteen-year time lapse? What does a beautiful fifty-year process look 
        like? How about fifty picoseconds? Is there an aesthetics of activity 
        on a split-second scale, on a multigenerational scale? What is the rose 
        doing that we can앖 see? </p>
      <p>H. Suppose Goldsworthy were a makeup artist. What would a human face 
        look like? Now suppose he was a plastic surgeon. </p>
      <p>I. Suppose he made clothes. Or houses. </p>
      <p>J. Goldsworthy once did some striking work at the North Pole. How about 
        underwater coral reefs? Deep-sea volvanic vent life? How about the surface 
        of the Moon? Sealed biospheres are popular desk toys now, but why are 
        they so modest? Why do they contain some algae and some brine shrimp sea-monkeys? 
        There압 plenty of room for ambition here: let압 see something the size 
        of a space station, full of blind cave life, or chemosynthetic tube worms. 
        Or new and awesome things that we don앖 permit to live outside of glass. 
      </p>
      <p>K,L, M, N (...). One of the most appealing aspects of Goldworthy압 work 
        is discovering the subtle infiltration of human intelligence in his altered 
        landscapes. There would seem to be a larger issue here: an aesthetics 
        of cybernetization. The infiltration of machine processing into the fabric 
        of the environment. </p>
      <p>A host of questions arises. </p>
      <p>What is the most elegant and attractive way to apply computational power 
        to a physical environment? How do you properly entangle bits and atoms 
        -- how do you properly entangle cybernetics and life? How does a 21st 
        century garden or forest properly tell you that it has become different, 
        that it is smart now? What are the principles involved in entangling biology 
        and symbolic analysis? </p>
      <p>Smart cars, smart houses, smart skyscrapers, monitored cities, weather 
        networks, satellite surveillance, the intelligent battlespace: where is 
        the artistic equivalent? Where is the biological equivalent? How does 
        computation properly enter the natural world? Through monitors first, 
        and then through augmentation? When and how does net.art become bio-art? 
      </p>
      <p>What does a smart flowerpot look like? A smart garden, a smart lawn, 
        a smart city park, a smart national wilderness, a smart continent? Is 
        there a map anywhere that shows how computation has moved, during the 
        last half of the twentieth century, into the textures of reality? If youre 
        not measuring it, youre not managing it. </p>
      <p>What would it take to make this invisible process of computation visible 
        -- and attractive, and beautiful, and a thing to be desired? </p>
      <p>Even the attempt to answer these questions would make us see a different 
        world -- the newly revealed cartography of a truly postindustrial epoch.
