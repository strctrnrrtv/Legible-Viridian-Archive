      <p> From: <a href="mailto:WarrenE@aol.com">WarrenE@aol.com</a> (Warren Ellis)</p>
      <p>Warren Ellis remarks: Noted French designer Philippe Starck is offering 
        a new manifesto and an accompanying design catalogue. Starck declares 
        that he wants to design an ethical future for his children. This may be 
        tangential to core Viridian concerns, but (it seems to me) it's of vast 
        interest to see this famed designer attacking environmental concerns in 
        the commercial arena, and with great energy and industry.</p>
      <p>Starck's "GoodGoods" catalog is not online, but can be ordered free from 
        the website. Below, some excerpts from Philippe Starck's introduction.</p>
      <p> "Non-products for non-consumers"</p>
      <p>by Philippe Starck</p>
      <p> "One fine day, several million years ago, Mrs Cromignonne and Mr Abominet 
        fell in love with their offspring. A new era dawned. Madame strove to 
        protect her infant, Monsieur, to improve posterity. Together, the two 
        of them -- the pragmatic mother and the idealistic, visionary father -- 
        invented the naive concept of progress, which was to be expressed chiefly 
        by the creation and manufacture of tools supposed to make our life easier 
        and even contribute to our happiness. Much, much later -- that is to say, 
        in our times -- it became evident that the most generous ideals tend to 
        be the first to degenerate.</p>
      <p> "Man found himself many a time a slave to the tools he created to serve 
        him. Although there are a few rare objects whose integrity, practicality 
        and sense of purpose have remained intact, a plethora of others exist 
        only for themselves, without humour, love or fancy. Farewell, dreams of 
        happiness...</p>
      <p> "As I matured, I realised I could try to correct an injustice to which 
        I was myself probably an accomplice.</p>
      <p> "Because I am neither a philosopher, nor a sociologist, nor a statesman; 
        because I lack the intelligence to grapple with the problem on theoretical 
        grounds, I decided to be pragmatic.</p>
      <p> "Grasping the wills and won'ts, the needs and desires of the citizen 
        I would like to have as a friend and neighbour, I have attempted to describe 
        the equipment he or she is likely to carry and maybe, through him or her, 
        catch a glimpse of the society in which I'd like to see my children and 
        those of my friends growing up.</p>
      <p> "What a vast, pretentious and naive programme this is.</p>
      <p> "I therefore tried to find, collect, correct or create (when necessary) 
        objects which are honest, responsible and respectful to people.</p>
      <p> "Not necessarily beautiful objects, but good objects.</p>
      <p> "I soon realised I was facing an impossible task. After research and 
        selection, very few products could meet my stringent standards. Yet, although 
        the ones I approved were still far from my ideal of perfection, they did 
        convey a certain spirit; an alternative direction, a new way of being.</p>
      <p> "Today, I am able to offer you a catalogue of these objects, a compendium 
        I would like to call a catalogue of 'non-products for non-consumers.' 
        (...)"</p>
      <p>Warren Ellis remarks:. What follows are: organic foods, organic clothes 
        (organic cotton, no chemical treatments, some grown on former coca land 
        in Peru), a series of t-shirts depicting the growth of a foetus to term 
        ("Pride becomes didactic"), slogan t-shirts ("Tomorrow will be less", 
        "Nous Sommes Les Mutants", "Moral Market"), shades ("governed by a commitment 
        to non-fashion"), bed linen, lamps, respirator masks ("to be safely equipped 
        for any possible technological, chemical, bacteriological or radioactive 
        mishap is neither a symptom of paranoia nor the sign of an excessively 
        pessimistic nature").</p>
      <p> Starck again: "Non-products are confronted with a grid of requirements 
        based on such criteria as: justification of existence, integrity of purpose, 
        longevity, moral elaboration, didacticism, political significance, symbolic 
        social significance, sexual significance, human responsibility, fair cost, 
        fair price, creativity, and, sometimes, humour, poetry and respect."</p>
      <p> GoodGoods is not an essentially Viridian enterprise. But it does provide 
        lessons. Starck exerts himself in the attempt to make living the GoodGoods 
        way <i>desirable</i>. He does his damnedest (it's probably more convincing 
        in the original French, but GoodGoods is solidly bilingual throughout) 
        to make GoodGoods a club, a tribe he's inviting you to join. He's spent 
        two years on this, and now he's providing you the chance to get in on 
        the ground floor with him.</p>
      <p> In a year's time, Pope-Emperor, you and yours will be faced with real-world 
        application to that same problem. Starck seems to me to be bench-testing 
        his solutions to that problem right now.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>(((Well, see, that's the advantage of being an actual designer like Philippe 
        Starck, as opposed to being a lame, English-speaking, sociophilosophical 
        sci-fi guy who intelligently grapples with this crap on theoretical grounds. 
        I spent a couple days inside a Philippe Starck hotel once. It was a very 
        swank joint, but it was like living in somebody's Filofax. Nevertheless, 
        I heartily concur with M. Starck that this is an excellent time to make 
        fools of ourselves with vast, pretentious and naive programs. He couldn't 
        be more right about that. Absolutely, Philippe! With you all the way, 
        mon frere! And this is no mere tepid theoretical agreement, either. I'm 
        gonna <i>buy</i> something of yours -- probably that Starck lemon juicer 
        that looks like a rocketship.)))</p>
      <p> (((The Viridian List will now enjoy a brief hiatus while my publisher 
        sends me out on the road to sign my new novel. If you're on the West Coast 
        of the USA and you feel some urge to press the papal flesh, drop on by.)))</p>
