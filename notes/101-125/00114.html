"Nicaragua Under Seige by Mitch-Aroused Vampire Bats"
<P>
by Glenn Garvin
<P>
<P>
"Cuyali, Nicaragua == The bats chittered nervously as
the flashlight's beam danced over them, their tiny white
fangs shining brightly.  The light dropped lower, catching
two old wooden support beams, a glistening black in the
shifting yellow light.  'That's blood,' whispered Aris
Mejia, 'pure blood.'"
<P>
(((Wow!  It's Pulitzer material!)))
<P>
<P>
(...)  "Nicaragua, which is regularly battered by
civil wars, earthquakes, volcanos, tidal waves and
hurricanes, is now under siege by thousands of vampire
bats.
<P>
<P>
"They've attacked at least 22 people this year,
resulting in one known death, and the toll of cattle, pigs
and chickens == favorite vampire targets == is unknown.
(...)
<P>
<P>
"Nicaragua's vampire bats are a native population but
were never much of a problem until Hurricane Mitch roared
through the northern part of the country last year.  The
widespread flooding and mudslides triggered by the
hurricane's heavy rains drove the bats from their rural
caves into populated areas. (...)
<P>
<P>
"And although literature on vampire bats is replete
with assurances that they rarely attack humans,
Nicaraguans know otherwise.  A small girl who lived in the
village of Las Brisas, 75 miles northeast of Managua, died
of rabies earlier this year after being bitten by a
vampire.  A few miles north, in El Espino, parents awoke
one night to find bats drinking the blood of both their
young daughters as they slept in their beds.
<P>
<P>
"Vampire bats have been sighted in nearly all of
Nicaragua's major cities, but the worst problems have come
in the northern provinces of Esteli and Madriz, in remote
mountain villages like this one.
<P>
<P>
"The 212 citizens of Cuyali, 80 miles north of the
capital and accessible only by a series of rutted dirt
tracks and dried riverbeds, have been fighting off the
bats for months.
<P>
<P>
"'Every night they're after us,'" said farmer Jesus
Lopez, 46.  "The cows, the horses and us, too.  We can't
really do anything about them.  Well, we've rubbed garlic
on the animals == the bats don't like that.'
<P>
<P>
"'The bats just don't like the odor,' he explained.
'And it only lasts one night.  If you don't put fresh
garlic on the animals the next night, the bats come back.'
<P>
<P>
"Though vampires are voracious eaters for their size
== they consume about 100 percent of their body weight per
night == a big meal is still only about eight teaspoons of
blood.  Their real danger is the diseases they carry,
including rabies, brucellosis and several illnesses fatal
to cattle."
<P>
<P>
(((And, as a final blood-sipping fillip:)))
<P>
<P>
"'We only kill the vampires in the colony, not any
insect-eating bats,' which are welcome in this land
plagued by hordes of mosquitoes carrying malaria and
dengue fever."
