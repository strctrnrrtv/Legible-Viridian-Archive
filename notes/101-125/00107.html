(((bruces remarks:  The mind boggles at the extent of
human suffering from these Bay of Bengal cyclones, which
occur with machine-like regularity.  However, today's
mega-storm reportage has a number of novel aspects, so
many that I had to footnote them.)))

"Cyclone strands 1 million in eastern India
<P>
by Dexter Filkins, Los Angeles Times
<P>
"More than 1 million people remained marooned Tuesday in
the villages of India's ravaged Eastern Coast, victims of
a massive cyclone that tore through this impoverished
region (1) and overwhelmed the government's attempts to
provide relief. (2)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Survivors clung to the tops of coconut trees.(3)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Bodies clogged waterways.(4)  Herds of cattle lay dead in
filthy water.(5)  Hungry people stormed food convoys (6),
while the army launched a spirited but inadequate campaign
to airdrop supplies to villagers (7) crowded on the small
islands of solid ground that dot the miles of flooded
plains.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Four days after the cyclone rode in from the Bay of
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Bengal with 155 mph winds and 10-foot waves, Indian
officials said they had failed to reach the overwhelming
majority of the 15,000 villages submerged or surrounded by
the floods, high tides and rains.  At least 30,000 people
were feared trapped inside cyclone shelters, buildings
perched on stilts (8) that have so far proved beyond the
reach of aid officials.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Estimates of the number of people killed in the storm
</BLOCKQUOTE>
continue to range widely, with most officials predicting
that the body count will top 5,000. (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "In the Orissa state capital, Bhubaneswar, 'There has
</BLOCKQUOTE>
been no electricity for three days.  We have no water.(9)
We are barely surviving,' said local reporter Debashis
Bhattacharyya, reached on one of the few functioning
satellite telephones. (10)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Bijay Mahapatra, a local politician who toured the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
devastated port of Paradwip, said he saw hundreds of
animal carcasses floating in the street.  Dump trucks were
called in to haul them away, but he said epidemics had
already been reported. (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Tens of thousands of people lined the roads Tuesday
</BLOCKQUOTE>
waiting for helicopters and trucks to bring food and
water.  Some said they had already been forced to drink
the water they stood in. (11)"

<A NAME="Section_1">
<H2>1.  "Impoverished regions" aren't spewing most of the</H2></A>
Greenhouse gases, but because of their meager emergency
services,  "impoverished regions" get clobbered to an
extent that is all out of proportion to their enviromental
crimes.  You can take it as a general Viridian principle
that the world's most nearly natural regions suffer most
intensely from unnatural disasters.
<P>
<A NAME="Section_2">
<H2>2.  Overwhelmed human infrastructure is the signature of a</H2></A>
"Wexelblat-style" Viridian Disaster.  The collapse of
relief infrastructure will become intensely politicized,
because there is someone handy to blame there.  The
underlying problem, global warming, will be shoved to the
back of the queue, because it's too large and nebulous for
partisan advantage.
<P>
<A NAME="Section_3">
<H2>3.  A nice concrete image here.  Viridian disasters are marked by their 
unheimlich and uncanny elements, which can be promoted to suggest that our 
climate is becoming not merely hotter, but unhinged.</H2></A>
<P>
<A NAME="Section_4">
<H2>4.  Presumably, <strong>animal</strong> bodies clogging waterways.  It's 
amazing how few people die in floods, when even hundreds of miles of heavily 
populated areas are underwater.</H2></A>
<P>
<A NAME="Section_5">
<H2>5.  Death is not the signature of the Greenhouse Effect.</H2></A>
It's not about Apocalypse; it's all about squalor.
<strong>Filth</strong> is the signature of the Greenhouse Effect: damp,
septic, reeking, clinging filth, with a nasty smell that
will probably linger all the way to the next record-
breaking storm.
<P>
<OL type=1 start=6 >
  <LI>  Perhaps some day the victims will wise up and storm coal mines instead.
  <P>
  <LI>  The Indian Army is a spirited outfit.  The Army may be
  outmatched by this storm, but they won't give up.  They'll
  just demand more money, more equipment, and more recruits.
  As disaster rates increase, we can predict increasingly
  militarization of Indian society.   In emerging nations,
  the Army is traditionally one of the few institutions that
  can get things done in a hurry.  Emerging "emergency
  nations" will have to lean more and more on martial law.
  <P>
  <LI>  I'm very interested in the design elements of these
  Indian "cyclone shelters perched on stilts."  One can
  imagine people all over the world coming to live in these
  things.  If the seas start rising, they're bound to boom
  in popularity.
  <P>
  <LI>  No water in the midst of unprecedented floods.
  Oxymorons like this are underpromoted in disaster
  coverage.
  <P>
  <LI>  Nice 90s touch with the satellite telephone.  Maybe
  there's an Iridium market after all.
  <P>
  <LI>  Sooner or later, we're <strong>all</strong> forced to drink the
  water we stand in.  Just like we're forced to breathe the
  atmosphere that we contaminate.
