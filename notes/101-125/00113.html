<P>
Speech at IDSA/IBM Designabout on Pervasive Computing
Palisades, New York, December 3, 01999
<P>
by Bruce Sterling
<P>
Let me get right down to virtual brass tacks here, and
tackle the issue at hand. I want to talk about my favorite
variety of so-called "pervasive computing."
<P>
<P>
This is a new, young concept, still in search of its
identity.  It's yet another little electronic frontier,
but there seem to be two main parts to it.
<P>
<P>
The first kind of pervasive computing is the kind
where data falls out of the sky, and oozes out of the
walls, and I've got some kind of hardware device on me,
and I'm computing with it.  The data is the pervasive
part, and I'm focussing it for my own purposes with some
GUI gizmo.   That is the high-bandwidth  wireless
Internet.  I have no problem believing in that.  It's not
at all farfetched.  A lot of money is going there, and
impressive things will be done.   But since I'm a science
fiction writer, I don't find it all that attractive.
<P>
<P>
Then there's the weirder junior version, the  second
model of pervasive computing, the "things that think"
version.  In this model, there is some limited bandwidth,
but basically, everything's got its own chip in it.
Everyday products have processing capacity as a matter of
course.  Onboard computation is inherent in all
postindustrial products.  As a futurist, I'm attracted to
this version because it's farther away and the
implications have been less explored.
<P>
<P>
There are no hard and fast lines between these two
models.   They're not exclusive, they could combine.  You
could have a zillion little chips marinating in a giant
wireless Internet.  But we already have a good running
start on the first version. The second model is still
mostly talk (though there is some great talk, such as Neil
Gershenfeld's book WHEN THINGS START TO THINK).
<P>
<P>
You cannot have pervasive computing without pervasive
power.  If my smallest source of practical electric power
has to be recharged and replaced all the time, then we're
living in laptop world and palmtop world. Cheap, smart,
ubiquitous objects would be out of the question.
<P>
<P>
There is a very stiff entry fee for a things-that-
think world.  I have to  deliver a fraction of a watt to a
few k of circuitry, dependably, for years on end, without
ever having to pay any attention. No wires, no plugs.
That's just not possible now.  But it may become possible.
Then we're living in world where forks can be smart. Where
bricks can be smart.  As for shoes,  shoes are extremely
smart.
<P>
<P>
For the sake of my speculation, let's just assume
that we've somehow beaten the battery problem. Let's
forecast how this technology might develop.  Basically, I
envision three stages.  Since this is a design conference,
let me sketch them for you.  There's a nice haptic
interface standing over here on this easel.  No one else
has used it.  But novelists like to run their demos on
paper.  (((Speaker uncaps a green marker.)))  Look!  It
affords greenness!
<P>
Step One.  The chip is detachable.  It glues on the
product as an afterthought.<BR>
Step Two.  The chip is a component.  It's built-in.
Step Three. The whole product has been re-designed around
the chip.  (((illustrations)))
<P>
Here's  how this trend  plays out in, say, the housing
market.
<P>
Step One.  You buy a home computer.  It comes in the
house, it goes out the house, big deal.
Step Two.  You're living inside a wired house.
Step Three.  You build a house because you decide you need
to shelter your network.
<P>
Here's how some physical devices fit in.
<P>
Step One. An antitheft tag.  Inventory tag.  A barcode.
Dumb, simple, uses an outside power source and outside
computing. You use them to tell where things are, what
they are, and how much they cost.  Available now.
Step Two. A GPS navigation unit in the dashboard of your
car.  It uses an outside signal to tell you where you are
and how to get where you're going.
Step Three.  The tires call you up on the phone and tell
you that their tread is wearing low and they ask
permission to have themselves replaced.
<P>
Running an enterprise:
<P>
Step One.  You have a security system to defend your
store's perimeter.  The doors and windows scream when
broken, and a silent alarm calls the police.
Step Two. You label all the items in your store with
location tags.  Nothing can leave the store unless its
legally purchased and logged out properly.
Step Three.  Anything you bring into your store is
automatically given a name and a network address.  It
knows what it is, where it is, who had it last, and what
condition it is in.  Because it was all built that way.
<P>
<P>
This product in step three is not a twentieth century
product.   The twentieth century didn't have this kind of
device at all.  It's unheard of. It's crying out for a
brand new name.  In fact the whole pervasive computing
field is calling out for a new terminology, because none
of the terms we have are working properly.  Pervasive
computing, ubiquitous computing, things that think,
intelligent environment, peripheral interfaces.   These
terms just don't get at the core of it.   Consider the
functionality of an anti-theft tag: "smart" isn't right,
"thinking" isn't right, "intelligent" isn't right.  But it
can save your retail business, and if you're a shoplifter
it can ruin your life.
<P>
<P>
"Smart" is old-fashioned.  I'm convinced that
intelligence is the wrong idea to apply to computation.
It's  a bad metaphor to call a machine "smart." It's
misleading, confusing, mistaken terminology.  To call
machine processing "intelligence" is  just not an accurate
description of the phenomenon.  It's like thinking that a
jet aircraft is migrating when it flies south.
<P>
<P>
This pervasive computing I'm describing is a reactive
network of small interacting devices fully integrated into
the physical fabric of products. It  keeps track of the
status of things.  It has software in it. The chip in its
core is programmable, and therefore capable of very
protean forms of behavior.   "Pervasive computing" is not
the best term for this. "Computing" is no good, because
the word "computation"  is about crunching numbers, not
about networked reactivity.  We need a  new 21st century
word.
<P>
<P>
Maybe something completely out of left field,
something like the term "polite."   A polite machine.
Your elderly frail grandmother asks, can I sit in this
chair?  And you answer yes of course, grandma, the chair
will adjust to your needs, it's polite. The problem with
the term "polite" is that  this pervasive  technology is
likely to find some of its best applications in the police
and the military.  Since they are objects that are
mechanically aware of their status and their surroundings,
maybe you could call them "wary."  They have software and
hardware inside, they're wary products.
<P>
<P>
Why would this imagined technology come into
existence? Well, not merely because we can do it.  This is
the Iridium fallacy.   It has to offer somebody some
tangible benefits.  Let's start by imagining a military
app. The military loves stuff that barely works.  They're
famous early adopters.
<P>
<P>
Imagine we've got two armies, the Balkan ethnic
separatist army of hardened guerrilla fighters, and that
soft, pampered,  high-tech army from the World Trade
Organization's military wing.  The guerrillas don't have
much equipment, just the occasional rifle and rocket
grenade.  But in the high-tech unit, every military object
has a unique ID, a location, a situation report, and a
network address.  We know how many  rifles we have, where
they are, and how far they are from the fire zone right
now. We know where our mortar is and how many rounds it
has left.  We know when a soldier is hit because his armor
knows it's been affected, and it tells us where he's hit,
and the direction the bullet came from.  We have much less
of the fog of war than our opponent, because we know
ourselves and our own capacities extremely well, and we
can learn about him much faster than he can learn about
us.  That's a critical military edge.
<P>
<P>
To test this thought experiment, imagine that the
guerrillas have all this pervasive computing and we don't.
All we've got is lots of guns, and nice uniforms and
helmets, and some big tanks.  How long do we stay alive in
the streets?  Not very long, I'm figuring.
<P>
<P>
Now a competitive angle in business.  I'm assembling
products in a factory and shipping them.  All my parts are
labelled, so I know all my inventory in real time.  The
shipped products talk to me on their way in, through, and
out of the plant.  They know whether they are complete and
assembled, and what they are missing, and if some
particular part has failed.   My competitor has a very
neat physical filing and storage system. Crates, pallets,
giant storage sheds, tarpaulins.  I've got this giant
higgledy piggledy mess. But my disorder is merely actual
disorder, it's not virtual disorder.  My virtual order is
more effective than his actual order, because it
searchable and reactive and wary and polite.  As long as
the parts know where they are, why should I care where
they are stacked?  It's not like anybody can steal them.
They're all automatically theftproof.
<P>
<P>
As a professional thief my life is very difficult ==
a bicycle might rat me out.  A stolen purse probably has
ten or twelve different objects,  all sending email to the
owner and the cops.
<P>
<P>
It's not that this world has no thieves or evil
people.  Let me be very clear about that. If I'm a bad guy
in this world, I probably live in a bad house with a bad
network of many bad objects. My welcome mat bites your
leg.  My broom gives your broom a virus.  I sell you wary
products with chips that lie to you, cheat you, break
themselves on purpose, misrepresent themselves, swindle
you.   Design doesn't abolish evil intent.  Pervasive
computing would be particularly well suited for
concentration camps.
<P>
<P>
The power to be your best is the power to be your
worst. I don't want to be simplistic, but I must be brief.
I  find myself  on the side of pervasive computing because
I believe that increased awareness is a basic good.  An
Information Society cannot properly seek security in
keeping bad people ignorant.  The proper cure for bad
information is more information, not secrecy or
censorship.  Open systems good.  Closed systems bad.
Tested algorithms good.  NSA algorithms bad.  If we're
gonna trust our lives to this kind of stunt, we've got to
get the guts of it fully out in the open. Open source
code, good. Trade-secret code, bad.  Level playing field,
good. Police state surveillance, bad.   Informed consent,
good. Sneaky web cookies, bad.  I could go on, but I want
to assure you that I'm not swallowing all this stuff  just
because I think it's hip.
<P>
<P>
Let's imagine that you've grown up with this
pervasive tracking technology. You trust it, you
understand it, you're at home with it.  If all your
possessions are network peripherals, then you have a
possible LINUX model for objects in the real world.   In
this world, I don't buy a hammer. What I really want to
own is the hammering functionality.  I might as well share
the hammer with my neighbor == he can't steal it, and if
he breaks it, I'll know immediately. A modern hammer in
this world comes built around a chip, with a set of strain
gauges that determine if it is worn or broke or abused.
Let's network that hammer.  We'll agree that our home-nets
will provide us with hammerability, and we'll pool our
resources to web-search for  bargain tools.
<P>
<P>
This ownership model might work better in China or
India rather than the highly individualistic US.  But
that's most of the human race. It's a form of social and
economic behavior that truly pervasive computing might
make plausible and workable.
<P>
<P>
My personal suspicion is that we have an overly
nervous attitude toward our possessions.   We are forced
by their dumb nature to pay far too much attention to the
things we own.   In this new world, if they're there,
they're there.  If they're not, I ask around for one on
the net.  If it doesn't exist locally, I rent it and give
it back.  I change its ID to mine if I really like it.
<P>
<P>
Now in my roundabout conclusion, I would like to
praise the one quality that I most admire about pervasive
computing,  possibly the first native computing form of
the 21st century.  I like it because it is novel and
powerful, but it is not metaphysical.  I like that it is
not transcendant, mindblowing or beyond all human grasp.
I like it that the people who've been discussing it here
have been talking about fashion and attractiveness and
attention, about the skin and the fingertips and the
eyelids,  and not about superhuman intelligence or some
kind of first-strike capacity.   This is a profound
technology, but it seems very practical to me,
refreshingly modest.  I like very much that it's not
sublime. Charlatans are generally sublime.  This is not  a
puffed-up hokum technology. It's not all self-consciously
startling, amazing, stunning and fantastic. I think we
have a chance here to create a powerful,  novel technology
with a new approach which is more mature that the 20th
century's approaches were. More tasteful and less
histrionic.
<P>
<P>
For contrast to what's been going on here, let's
consider, say, a typically native twentieth century
technology, adopted with stereotypical, definitive,
twentieth-century motives and attitudes.  Nuclear fission.
Atomic power.   Let's imagine ourselves at the dawn of
atomic power, instead of at  the dawn of pervasive
computing.  It's a meeting of the hush-hush Atomic Energy
Commission.  We're being confidentially  briefed by our
speaker, and he's a high-security egghead in a labcoat
from a secret research base somewhere in the desert. He's
got a cloud of dry ice fumes around him,  and he's deadly
serious and kind of trembling with technological
exaltation, and he says:
<P>
<P>
"Behold the mighty atom!  Through our unprecedented
mastery of cosmic forces, we have unleashed a fantastic
source of limitless power.  Our goal now is to  bring this
great boon to the masses."
<P>
<P>
And what does the audience say?   Well, we were
twentieth century people then, so we said, "Hosanna!  At
last we have some source of hope to counteract the ghastly
horror of Nagasaki and Hiroshima!"  Because Utopia is the
psychic flipside of Apocalypse, you see?  They both come
from the same deep wellspring in the human soul. A basic
inability to deal with it.
<P>
<P>
What we should have said in that circumstance was
something else entirely. A better and more sophisticated
response.  A very 21st century response. We should have
said, "What about the garbage?"
<P>
<P>
"What garbage," our speaker would have replied.
<P>
<P>
"Radioactive garbage.  Spent fuel rods, dead uranium,
labcoats that glow in the dark, that kind of thing."
<P>
<P>
"HA!  I can only laugh and scoff at your mundane
query!   Only a Luddite philistine with his tiny mind in
the gutter could fail to see that splitting the mighty
atom is civilization's way forward."
<P>
<P>
"I'm cool about ways forward, man.  But you're not
addressing my issue.  What about the garbage?  Do YOU want
the garbage?  Can we put the garbage in your basement?"
<P>
<P>
"No way!"
<P>
<P>
"Can we store the garbage in your city?  Can we store
the garbage in your state?"
<P>
<P>
"No!  NO!"  He's starting to sweat now.  It's a kind
of return of the repressed thing going on here, you see.
<P>
<P>
Let me let you in on something.  The coming century is
not an atom-science, rocket-science world.  It's a design
world.  It may even be an atom-design world, with
nanotechnology, or a rocket-design world, with way too
many New World Order cruise missiles. But it's a world of
intimate consumer technologies, not state-supported, mind-
blowing, Soviet super-projects.
<P>
<P>
The first thing you ought to ask a wizard in an ivory
tower is not "what wonders can you show us, Mr Wizard,"
but "do you recycle?"
<P>
<P>
Really.  That is a serious, crucial modern question.
What about the garbage? What about the underside?  What
part is technically obscure and what part is deliberately
hidden?    Quit bragging about your cosmic mastery while
you make that sudden lunge for my wallet.   I don't want
you to run the world from behind the lead shielding.  I
want to know that I can put my own hands inside the black
box and mess about with it,  if I feel that I have to.
Don't impress me; ask my real opinion, cut me in on the
action, make me a stakeholder. Don't build your profit
margin on the prim assumption that I'm stupid.  Stupid
people don't have the money in an information society.  In
an information society, smart people don't even want the
money; we want the equity.
<P>
<P>
With pervasive computing, we may create a system that
gives us a new kind of stake in the physical world.   It
is a genuinely novel relationship between human beings and
their material surroundings.  For the world of design,
that is a very big deal. It may even be a big deal for the
world, period.
<P>
<P>
Where is the garbage?  you may ask.  Excellent
question! And what an answer I have for you.  Is a world
of smart gizmos the garbage is smart! It's smart garbage!
The garbage-can always reads the barcode when the junk
goes in!  Smart garbage doesn't fester in darkness,
ignorance and denial. It becomes  a resource.  Or it can
be, if we handle it right. If we design it properly.
Nothing fated about that.  We have to deal with it.
Nothing is set in stone there.  The future is unwritten.
An unwritten future is  good!
<P>
<P>
The twenty-first century is dawning in a rather
lovely and promising way.   It may become a terrible
century, but I see no compelling reason for that.   Our
worst dangers are not our new opportunities.  They are our
bad habits.  Our bad habits can go.  We won't miss them as
much as we think.
<P>
<P>
This was a good conference. The material is great.
This stuff is sincere, it's authentic, it's brand-new and
full of promise.  And we're right up against it, we're as
close to the future here as I've ever seen a group of
people get.   We should be happy and pleased about this.
We should have a really good time.
