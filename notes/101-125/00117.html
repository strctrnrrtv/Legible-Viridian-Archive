Subject: Viridian Note 00117: Internet Energy 3<BR>
To: Viridian List &lt;<A HREF="mailto:viridian@fringeware.com">viridian@fringeware.com</A>&gt;<BR>
<P>
Key concepts: Internet energy consumption, growth rates,<BR>
carbon consumption, new economy
<P>
Attention Conservation Notice:  It's a righteous sermon on
the beauty and promise of the Internet from New Economy /
New Energy activists.  Last of three parts.
<P>
(((Highlights from an executive summary of a much more
extensive article at <A HREF="http://www.cool-companies.org/">www.cool-companies.org</A>.)))
<P>
<P>
"The world is only beginning to come to grips with
the complex consequences of the exploding growth of e-
commerce and the Internet economy.
<P>
<P>
"This paper reflects an analysis of currently
available but incomplete data, and begins to construct
some rough scenarios. (...) Hopefully these scenarios
begin the process of identifying opportunities and
challenges for business leaders and policy makers and
suggesting the directions of future research and
initiatives.
<P>
<P>
"The nation experienced remarkable economic growth in
1997 and 1998, about 4% per year(...)  The overall
productivity of the economy appears to have increased
substantially, driven by the IT  sector. (..) During those
same two years, the nation's energy consumption == the
principal source of air pollution and the gases linked to
global warming == hardly grew at all. In the previous 10
years, U.S. energy intensity, measured in energy consumed
per dollar of gross domestic product declined (i.e.,
improved) by under 1% per year. In both 1997 and 1998, it
improved by more than 3% == an unprecedented change during
a time of low energy prices. In 1998, U.S. emissions of
greenhouse gases rose only 0.2%, the smallest rise since
1991 (which was a recession year).
<P>
<P>
"The analysis suggests that mainstream forecasts may
be overestimating U.S. energy and carbon dioxide emissions
in the year 2010 by up to 5% == while significantly
underestimating overall U.S. economic growth.
<P>
<P>
"(...)  The Internet economy itself seems to be
generating both structural  gains and efficiency gains.
<P>
<P>
"Internet energy efficiency gains potentially cover
a broad spectrum of activity. In business-to-consumer e-
commerce, for instance, a warehouse can contain far more
products like books per square foot than a retail store.
Warehouses themselves also typically use far less energy
per square foot than a retail store. So books and other
products sold over the Internet would likely consume less
energy per book then traditional retail-based sales.
<P>
<P>
"More important is business-to-business e-
commerce, which is estimated at 5 to 10 times the size of
business-to-consumer e-commerce. As traditional
manufacturing and commercial companies put their supply
chain on the Internet, and reduce inventories,
overproduction, unnecessary capital purchases, paper
transactions, mistaken orders, and the like, they achieve
greater output with less energy consumption.
<P>
<P>
"Another important effect is that the Internet
appears to be promoting greater use of home offices,
allowingtelecommuters to spend less time at the office and
also spawning many purely home-based businesses. (...)
This shift will increase energy consumption in homes, but
will likely save far greater energy in avoided office
building construction and utility bills, as well as
reduced commuting energy.
<P>
(((Better yet, as a home-based author in the digitally
assisted culture industry, I'm doing all these things
already without any special effort, and am beginning to
feel all warmly self-righteous about it.)))
<P>
<P>
"There are aspects of the Internet that will
probably entail more energy use, such as greater small-
package delivery by truck. These cases may not, however,
result in a net increase in energy use; efficient package
delivery by truck may replace at least in part inefficient
personal driving to malls, supermarkets, bookstores and
the like. This will be particularly true if most of the
packages are delivered by the Post Office, which already
passes virtually every home in the country  daily.
<P>
(((Those Viridian T-shirts will be shipped surface from
the US Post Office from now on  (unless you are Russian,
in which case you get them airmail because your economy is
so thoroughly downsized already.))))
<P>
<P>
"The Internet is growing so quickly, and data on
it remain so inadequate, that it is certainly not possible
to draw more than tentative conclusions at this point
(particularly in areas as difficult to analyze as the
possible substitution of Internet  use for
transportation). That is why we have labeled this analysis
a scenario, and not a prediction.
<P>
<P>
(((Others might label this analysis "wishful
thinking" or even "spin doctoring," but so what? If we can
just get the New Economy people in our corner, we can tank
those ugly coal guys overnight!)))
<P>
<P>
"We believe the Internet may already be reducing
the energy intensity of the industrial sector, and that it
holds the potential to have its most significant impact in
this area. If so, this would be the Internet's biggest
impact on the environment, since this  sector is
responsible for a third of the nation's air pollution and
the vast majority of its hazardous waste and other
pollutants.
<P>
<P>
"We believe the Internet could significantly
reduce the contribution of the commercial building sector
to the nation's energy intensity, and that gains in this
sector will likely outweigh increases in electricity use
in residential buildings. We suspect the Internet economy
will be no worse than neutral in the transportation
sector, but could well have a large positive impact. In
general, we believe one label commonly used for e-
commerce, 'frictionless,' has a useful analogy here.
Friction causes energy to be lost. Frictionless commerce
saves energy.
<P>
<P>
"If, indeed, the Internet is already reducing
energy intensity, then it is likely to have a very big
impact in the years to come. The Internet economy is
projected to grow more than ten-fold-from its current
level of tens of billions of dollars today to more than $1
trillion in a few years. Moreover, while the Internet
economy remains a small share of the total U.S. economy,
it represents a much higher fraction of the growth in the
economy. That is the essential point for this paper(...)
<P>
<P>
"We believe the combination of trends described
above makes it likely that the years 1997 to 2007 (and
probably beyond), will not see the same low-level of
energy intensity gains that the previous 10 years saw,
which were under 1% per year. We expect annual
improvements in energy intensity of 1.5%-and perhaps 2.0%
or more. If this comes to pass, most major economic models
used in the country will need to be modified."
