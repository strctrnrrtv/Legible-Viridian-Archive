<P>
Key concepts: comments from readers of Viridian List,<BR>
pervasive computing, neologisms
<P>
Attention Conservation Notice:  They're people just like
you, so heaven only knows if they're worth hearing.  Over
1,500 words.
<P>
(((Viridian Note 00113, "Pervasive Computing," ventured
the remarks:)))
<P>
"The twentieth century didn't have this kind of  device at
all.  It's unheard of. It's crying out for a  brand new
name.  In fact the whole pervasive computing  field is
calling out for a new terminology, because none
of the terms we have are working properly.  (...)
We need a  new 21st century  word."
<P>
<P>
(((The terms "polite" and "wary" were offered in the
speech, but these metaphors still miss the mark.
Networked machines, being machines, are neither polite nor
wary.  List readers had further suggestions.)))
<P>
From:  gdyson@cc.wwu.edu^* (George Dyson)<BR>
<P>
"'Pervasive computing' sounds like what Olaf Stapledon
('Star Maker,' 1937) called the (evidently Bluetooth
equipped) 'Minded Swarm':
<P>
<P>
"'So perfectly organized was the life of the minded
swarm that all routine activities of industry and
agriculture had become, from the point of view of the
swarm's mind, unconscious, like the digestive processes of
a human being... The little insectoid units themselves
carried on these operations consciously, though without
understanding their significance; but the mind of the
swarm had lost the power of attending to them.'
<P>
<P>
"My own suggestion would be 'Overmind' for those
processes that are too distributed for us to comprehend,
and 'Undermind' for those local processes, however
collectively intelligent, that are too individually
understandable to be credited with intelligence at this
time. This leaves us in the middle, which is where we
belong."
<P>
<P>
(((That's a useful distinction of scale, but it still
leaves us with the anthropomorphic assumption that machine
processing involves "mind" and is somehow
"intelligent.")))
<P>
From: pjd@cne.gmu.edu^^^^^^^^^** (Peter J. Denning)<BR>
<P>
"I liked your piece about pervasive computing.  I was
thinking that software in your toothbrush and shoelaces
and such might be called 'awareware.'"
<P>
(((I rather like this, but "awareware" is too hard to say
and spell. It's also anthropomorphic.  Plus, it looks
Japanese.  The Japanese phrase "mono no aware" (a kind of
pastel, transitory melancholy) is a particularly apt term
for rapid technological transitions.)))
<P>
From:  kevin@wired.com** (Kevin Kelly)<BR>
<P>
"Pervasive computing means linking, not thinking. 'Things
that Link,' not 'Things that Think.'  Linked shoes, linked
chairs, linked cement, linked umbrellas."
<P>
(((This seems very close to the mark, but web "links" may
have used up all the semantic vigor in the term "link.")))
<P>
From: tater@Catch22.com^^**? (Brad Bulger)<BR>
<P>
<P>
"I'm thinking about a world where the salt and pepper
shakers are talking to the broom and the cereal bowl.
Though the word 'social' could work, it's awkward.
Unfortunately the other term that springs to mind is
'magic.' Or 'enchanted.'   Or 'disney,' even worse.  A
disney fork. As long as they don't sing."
<P>
<P>
(((You've got to give the Disney Corp. credit for
branding talking teapots before they even exist.)))
<P>
From: pbundman@dht.com* (Philip Bundman)<BR>
<P>
<P>
"Both 'polite' and 'wary' seem a bit over-the-top.  I
propose the name 'alert technology.'"
<P>
<P>
(((Thanks for the apt proposal, but "alert" makes me
feel even more nervous than "wary.")))
<P>
From: SeJ@aol.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^******?<BR>
(Stefan Jones)
<P>
"One of the guys at work dredged up a nifty, archaic word
== 'coadunation' == to label a way that separate servers
could be configured to back each other up,  and act as one
apparent whole to the outside world.
<P>
<P>
"'Coadunation' is too good a word to use just for that.
I think a 'coadunation' should be a cohort of enchipped
devices. They're all hooked into a greater  network, of
course, but it's the way they're put together == acting
together for you == that makes your coadunation useful.
<P>
<P>
"Much better to call them this than to repurpose
'hive' or 'gestalt'.  (Although, like a hive, coadunations
would shed and lose members through time  and space. And
who cares what particular widget is filling a slot, as
long as the whole gestalt works?)
<P>
<P>
"The word 'coadunation' has some almost-forgotten
occult meanings, glopped on by  theosophists, but if it
gets used properly, those will slip away."
<P>
(((The concept here is great, but there's too many
syllables in "coadunation" and it's hard to spell.)))
<P>
From: r1ddl3r@bp13.u.washington.edu^^*** (Michael Lynn)<BR>
<P>
<P>
"If I were to come up with a word for this type of
pervasive computing, I'd run with variations on 'agent,'
such as: actor, artificer, butler, creature, delegate,
diplomat, domestic, emissary, employee, envoy, executor,
functionary, go-between, lackey, menial, operative,
puppet, representative, servant, symbiont.
<P>
<P>
"The following would have the most sensational/public
appeal: Butler, creature, domestic, executor (the military
would love that one), operative, and symbiont.
<P>
<P>
"There might be categories within this type of
computing, based on how actively an object interacts with
other objects. 'Managerial' computing comes to mind. Or my
personal favorite: 'pimp' computing."
<P>
<P>
(((That's a valiant effort to squeeze some fresh
meaning out of the thesaurus.  I'm rather liking the terse
term "lackey," and "pimp computing" surely has a smell of
the future about it.  But I'm afraid we still need the
hard work of an actual neologism.  We Viridians should
keep trying.  The proper vaporware term for this
technology may inspire a market boom worth billions!)))
<P>
From: Sebastian Mendler &lt;<A HREF="mailto:smendler@well.com">smendler@well.com</A>&gt;<BR>
<P>
"In the midst of everything else, you dropped this on
them:
<P>
'Imagine we've got two armies, the Balkan ethnic
separatist army of hardened guerrilla fighters, and that
soft, pampered,  high-tech army from the World Trade
Organization's military wing.'
<P>
"Did anybody even <strong>blink</strong> when you said that??  Or did
they just go 'Yeah, OK, uh-huh, I'm with you so far...'?"
<P>
(((They all went "Yeah, OK, uh-huh, I'm with you so
far.")))
<P>
From:  whiz@ricochet.net^^^^^^^^**** (Michael Treece)<BR>
<P>
"Your Holiness-Majesty,
<P>
"This pervasive computing thing worries me greatly.  You
had mentioned, in your address to the IBM (!) folks,
'Police state surveillance, bad.' Unfortunately, such a
system as you envision lends itself beautifully to police-
state surveillance, and it's hard for me to think of any
way in which to prevent that surveillance.
<P>
<P>
"This is the uber-ECHELON, the ultimate anti-privacy
step.  It would be very difficult for commercially
available systems to be encrypted, and the possibility of
using a non-removable/integral inventory control tag (for
example) in a pair of boots (for example) to monitor the
movements of an EarthFirst! activist (for example) is real
== without the cops (on whatever level, of whatever type)
having to invest in anything more cutting-edge than an
off-the-shelf retail system with a hopped-up receiver.
This begs for the gentle touch of Ned Ludd.  Open the pod
bay doors, HAL."
<P>
<P>
(((I take your point.  We may fail to look properly at
the underside, and enter a pervasive computing system
designed for evil.  We may find ourselves living in a
historically unprecedented nightmare:  a sooty, eco-
collapsed world of Orwellian cybercommunism, where an
Environmental Emergency State owns and documents every
tenpenny nail, and  even the vodka bottles rat us out to
Big Brother.
<P>
<P>
(((But we can make the same argument about the
Internet.  Is it marvelously empowering, or is it a giant
scary 'net' for the police (for example) to pursue you and
invade your privacy, using off the shelf equipment?
Journalists like myself (for example) are prime invaders
of the privacy of inoffensive parties, including well-
meaning guys who want nothing more than the healthful
exercise of spiking trees, demolishing bridges and filling
bulldozers with sugar and emery powder.  Can't something
be done about these media busybodies with their menacing
files and archives?
<P>
<P>
(((Then there's coal technology.  It's so ancient,
ominpresent and taken-for granted that is scarcely even
merits the bravura term 'technology'.  Yet it's visibly
destroying our climate, with consequences none will
escape, least of all Earth First! saboteurs. The devil we
don't know seems impossibly scary to us, while the devil
we ignore is already at our throat and in our lungs.
<P>
<P>
(((Perhaps there are some technologies which mankind
was simply not meant to know.  I might concede this; Faust
had to.  Nuclear fission would likely have topped the list
of healthfully forbidden topics, but it's too late now for
ignorance to protect us from the consequences of power we
already have. Pervasive computing may be another quagmire.
But unless we publicly talk about it, who is to judge?
<P>
<P>
(((Who is going to deny you this kind of knowledge?
Who do you trust to deny you this?  When General Ludd,
that all-wise fellow, tells you that he is depriving you
of certain computers for your own good and the safety of
others, will you thank him?  Who exactly are your trusted
guardians, standing ready to pull HAL's plugs when things
get dicey?   Will you ask them what else they know about
computer networks that you will never know?  Will you ever
think to ask the network's secret masters about ECHELON,
for instance?  And will they tell you the truth when you
ask?
<P>
<P>
(((When it comes to networks, 'the architectural is
political.'  Is there any security in obscurity?   Exactly
how ignorant do we want to be about pervasive computing?
How ignorant should IBM be, or the police be, or Earth
First! be?   Take this as a given: any technological limit
a government imposes on its own sworn officers of the law
will be imposed ten times over on dangerous, loose-cannon
civilians.)))
