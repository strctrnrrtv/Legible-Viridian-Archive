Key concepts: weather disasters, freak storm, Paris<BR>

Attention Conservation Notice:  Why read email about
horrific weather in the capital of France?  It's all over
the news anyway.

<BR>
(((Here's a hearty welcome for the New Year. Paris
is a freak weather disaster area.  No, not Venezuela,
not Orissa; Paris.)))
<P>
"Deadly Storm Surprises Europe"
<P>
(((Spectacular photo  of eviscerated building spewing
insulation.))) "In France, residents make their way
through the debris of a building roof that fell in the
street in Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives, Normandy, on Sunday.
Hurricane-force winds blasted across northern France and
parts of Switzerland and Germany on Sunday, injuring
hundreds and killing as many as 62 people.  Winds reached
an unprecedented 95 mph in the heart of Paris. Damage was
extensive.  Story, A13."
<P>
(((Believe it or not, not every storm that's out there can
win the coveted title of "Viridian Disaster."  I didn't
even break stride over those tens of thousands of hapless
Venezuelans recently buried in mud.  But hey:
unprecedented ninety-five mile-an-hour winds, pouncing on
Paris out of nowhere?  That's like something out of a J.
G. Ballard novel.)))
<P>
<P>
"The freak gales, which reached an unprecedented 95 mph
in the heart of Paris, left broken branches and uprooted
trees along the Champs Elysee, smashed windows at
Versailles and littered Paris with twisted awnings, roof
tiles and Christmas trees ripped from their planters.
(((So much for the "wired trees" of downtown Paris (see
Viridian Note 00050).  Certain trees of Paris had computer
chips inside them that were supposed to give readouts of
their "location, age, and condition."  One rather doubts
they were programmed to read "I'm underfoot in the Champs
Elysee, crushed by historically unprecedented winds.")))
<P>
<P>
"Rows of neatly parked motorcycles lay mangled in
piles in the streets, and huge sheets of roofing and
television dishes rested in gutters." (((Very nice touch
there with the blown-away satellite dishes.  This isn't
just any old village laid waste here; it's the global
village.)))  "Many Paris tourist sites closed for fear of
further falling debris, including Disneyland Paris, where
six people were injured by falling branches."  (((A
weather disaster in Disneyland. Enough said.)))
<P>
<P>
"Most of Paris' gardens and public spaces aren't
expected to open until late today as crews work to remove
debris.  Mayor Jean Tiberi called for the city to be
declared a disaster area and asked for state money to help
with repairs."  (((State money, is it?  I suppose weather
insurance would be out of the question these days == see
Viridian Notes 00021, 00022, 00023.)))
<P>
<P>
"The storm also pushed tons of spilled fuel oil onto
the beaches along France's Atlantic coast, where bad
weather has hindered efforts to contain the damage caused
two weeks ago when a tanker broke up in stormy seas."
(((One might have known there would be a "Wexelblat
disaster" angle to all this.  Dripping oil spills, plus
broken tankers, plus weather violence; could there be a
Baudelarian poetic connection here?  No, no... it's too
ironic and cynical.)))
<P>
<P>
"Stormy weather had been predicted, but the force of
the winds took meteorologists by surprise.  In Paris, such
winds have never been recorded before, officials said."
(((If today's meteorologists don't somehow get over their
permanent state of befuddled surprise, they'll lose all
credibility.  It's simple, fellas:  you just look into the
camera and say, "It is the Greenhouse Effect.  It's all
surprises now.")))
<P>
<P>
"In France, 2 million households were without power
Sunday."  (((Hope they can tell this apart from the
effects of Y2K.)))
<P>
<P>
"In Paris, falling debris was blamed for most deaths.
In Argenteuil, a couple died when the roof of their
apartment building caved in.  One woman, apparently
walking her dog, drowned when she was swept into a river
near Strasbourg, France.  One woman was blown into Le
Havre harbor.
<P>
<P>
"In Switzerland, where winds reached 120 mph, a
skier was killed in the resort of Crans Montana when an
uprooted tree crashed into the cable of a ski lift,
sending the gondola they were in crashing down."
