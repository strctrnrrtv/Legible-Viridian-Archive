cheap wine.

"Check it out!  I figured out how to make the EPA's
environment map a little more  dynamic, by adding a field
on my web page where the user can type in a zip code.
Now, instead of a static link to one map, the user can fly
over the entire  U.S.A. and check out the damage
nationwide!"<BR>

As you know, we Viridians are determined to solicit
honest, design-centered assessments of today's cutting-
edge Green products.
<P>
Let's be perfectly frank about this: excellent
environmental policies don't make your product taste any
better.
<P>
Since the Fetzer wineries recently expressed their
intention to run their enterprises on 100% renewable
power, we painstakingly purchased an extensive
representative set of Fetzer's product.  These modestly
priced vintages put a suspiciously small dent in the
Viridian party budget.   We then assembled a testimonial
panel of semi-willing guinea pigs.  Critical highlights
follow.
<P>
<BR>
Fetzer Sauvignon Blanc '97:
<P>
"Feels like a base for a spiked fruit punch."
"Characterless."<BR>
"Sickly -sweet. A bust."
<P>
Fetzer Sundial Chardonnay '98:
<P>
"Slick."<BR>
"Nauseating."<BR>
"Shuddersome."
<P>
Johannisberg Riesling '97:
<P>
"Fruity, full-flavored, a great backseat teenage date
drink."<BR>
"Cloying."<BR>
"An order of magnitude better than the Sauvignon Blanc."
<P>
White Zinfandel '98:
<P>
"Evokes underage, broke teenagers on the beach.  I can
almost taste the sand."<BR>
"Thin, watery, inoffensive."
"A real seven-dollar wine."
<P>
Fetzer Valley Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon '97:
<P>
"Chalk made out of skunk droppings."
"I wouldn't drink it regularly, but if it came out of a
restaurant carafe, I wouldn't be that unhappy."
"This vintage is a long way from coming into its own, not
that I'm anxiously waiting."
<P>
But the all around consumer winner was, without question,
the Fetzer '97 Merlot.  It was widely accepted, if
somewhat grudgingly.  Perhaps the most sincere compliment
is that this was the only Fetzer bottle found empty next
morning.  The rest had to be cermoniously decanted down
the Viridian Vatican's kitchen sink.
<P>
Eagle Park Merlot '97:
<P>
"Comparable to any analogous Texas vintage."
<P>
"Keep trying!  Not any worse than wine from environmental
offenders!"
<P>
"Woody.  Mouth-filling. Has some character.  Either this
is pretty potable, or it's getting drunk outside."
