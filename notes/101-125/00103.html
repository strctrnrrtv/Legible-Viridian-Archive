"Religious Leaders Take Action Against Global Climate
Change; Pennsylvania Council of Churches Launches
Interfaith Campaign
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "HARRISBURG, Pa., Oct. 7 /PRNewswire/ == Leaders of
</BLOCKQUOTE>
more than two dozen church bodies, including Protestant
denominations, the Greek Orthodox Church and the
Philadelphia Board of Rabbis, have signed an historic
Religious Leaders Statement on Global Warming.
<P>
"The Religious Leaders Statement warns that human
beings are doing violence to God's creation by causing
global warming and calls for people of faith to be
stewards of His creation.
<P>
"'Our faith demands that we act as stewards of
creation, not squander and destroy God's gifts,' said the
Rev. Brenda Brooks of the Presbyterian Synod of the
Trinity.  'Global climate change is destroying people's
lives and health, as well as our habitat.  In these
circumstances, failure to act would be truly immoral.'
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The Religious Leaders Statement calls for persons of
</BLOCKQUOTE>
faith to take three immediate steps to protect the
creation from global warming.
<P>
"Those steps are:
<P>
"(1) urging elected officials to support public policies
that will reduce greenhouse gases, including ratification
of the Kyoto Treaty;
<P>
"(2) reducing energy usage at homes, businesses, and
places of worship with simple and readily available energy
conservation measures; and
<P>
"(3) using Pennsylvania's Electricity Choice program to
buy electricity that has been certified as renewable
energy by the Green-e program.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "These three steps will reduce global warming gases
</BLOCKQUOTE>
like carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere.  For
example, an electricity customer using 1,000 kilowatt-
hours per month who switches his electricity supply to
Green-e certified renewable electricity eliminates
approximately 19,729 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions,
which are produced by fossil fuel-powered electric
generation plants, from being released into the atmosphere
each year.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Reducing the emission of global warming gases is
</BLOCKQUOTE>
vital, because global temperatures have increased by 1
degree Fahrenheit in the past century and the ten warmest
years on record have been since 1983.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "To encourage millions of Pennsylvanians to take one
</BLOCKQUOTE>
of or all of the three recommended actions to stop global
warming, the Pennsylvania Council of Churches is launching
a coordinated campaign to call upon people of faith to
work to prevent global warming as a matter of 'religious
responsibility.'
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The campaign is making available to the public a
</BLOCKQUOTE>
brochure entitled 'Global Warming &amp; Electric Restructuring
in Pennsylvania: a temptation or an opportunity?' For more
information on the brochure, contact the PA Interfaith
Global Climate Change Campaign at 717-545-4761."
