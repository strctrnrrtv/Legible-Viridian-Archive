Key concepts: Internet energy consumption, growth rates,<BR>
carbon consumption, new economy
<P>
Attention Conservation Notice:  It's lots of handwaving
and back-of-the-envelope calculations about Internet
energy consumption.  Part 2 of 3.

analysis
<P>
"Dear Colleagues,
<P>
"There has a been much discussion recently about the
electricity consumption associated with the Internet.
Mark  Mills claimed in an article in Forbes<BR>
(<A HREF="http://forbes.com/forbes/99/0531/6311070a.htm">http://forbes.com/forbes/99/0531/6311070a.htm</A>)
and in a supporting report (Mills 1999, at<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.fossilfuels.org/Electric/internet.htm">http://www.fossilfuels.org/Electric/internet.htm</A>), that
such electricity use currently accounts for about 8% of
all electricity use in the U.S."
<P>
(((If the Greening Earth Society had just kept their
mouths shut about this, instead of crazily boasting that
the Internet guarantees full employment in coal mines,
nobody would have raised the question.  Now actual
scientists are addressing this issue, and their answer
must be rather disconcerting for the carbon lobby.)))
<P>
<P>
"We examined the assumptions behind Mills'
calculations of current electricity use in detail. Even if
one accepts the validity of calculating electricity
consumption 'associated with the internet' in isolation,
the estimates for direct electricity use in Mills' report
are too large by a factor of eight.

(((Some highlights of the analysis follow.)))
<P>
<P>
"Scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL) examined the Forbes numbers(...). Large errors were
found in every category, including the calculations for
energy used by major dot-com companies, Web servers,
Internet routers, telephone switches and the PCs used in
both homes and business.
<P>
<P>
"Worse, the Forbes authors also have their basic
energy facts wrong. They said a 'typical computer and its
peripherals require about 1,000 watts of power.' In fact,
the average PC and monitor use about 150 watts of power,
which dips to 50 watts or less in sleep mode. New flat
screens use about a quarter of the energy of traditional
video display terminals with cathode ray tubes. Printers
and peripherals are usually shared by multiple users, and
don't increase this average very much. Laptops, a key
growth segment, are particularly low energy users; newer
models sometimes use less than 30 watts."
<P>
<P>
(((I don't have to be as charitable as scientists do,
so let me bluntly declare that that Forbes article was
planted from the get-go by Greening Earth Society.  It's a
pack of self-serving lies, intended to be cited again and
again by anti-Kyoto Congressional aides in search of
"facts."  The authors and their sponsors are not merely
"wrong," they are fanatical political operatives and they
are deliberately obscurantist.)))
