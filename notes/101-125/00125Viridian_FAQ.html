out on the list a while, you know all this already.

VIRIDIAN FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
<HR>
<P>
<BR>
"Why don't you have the domain <A HREF="http://www.viridian.com?/">www.viridian.com?</A>"
<P>
We're not a commercial organization.  If we had a site,
we'd be a viridian.org, or better yet viridian.arts.  In
any case, success for us intrinsically involves spewing
our creations into <b>other people's</b> sites.  It doesn't pay
for us to coop our freeware, noncommercial propaganda up
on a single site.  Besides, they're too much work.
<P>
"How come some people on Viridian List have lots of ^^^^^
and **** after their log-in names?"
<P>
Those symbols of achievement are known as "chevrons" (^)
and "stars" (*).  You get a chevron if you send in some
useful piece of information to the list moderator,
<A HREF="mailto:bruces@well.com">bruces@well.com</A>.  If something you create appears publicly
on the Viridian List,  then you receive the highly coveted
star, to symbolize your star turn on the public stage.
The most direct way to receive a star is to enter a
Viridian Design Contest.
<P>
People with a lot of stars and chevrons outrank you.  You
should feel confident in devoting respectful attention to
them.
<P>
"What's a Viridian Design Contest?"
<P>
The contests are opportunities for graphic or conceptual
creativity. Logos, posters, teapots, lamps, that sort of
thing.  We do this to amuse ourselves, and to give some
coherent form to our ideas. Images and symbols are every
bit as important to the Viridian Movement as our constant
outflow of rants.
<P>
There's a Viridian contest archive at:
<A HREF="http://www.bomoco.com/Viridian/viridian.htm">http://www.bomoco.com/Viridian/viridian.htm</A>
You can see from this site that Viridian design entries
are not necessarily professional-level efforts in
postindustrial design.  Rather, they're a fun opportunity
to show others that you not only "get it" == you have the
strength and energy to give it back.
<P>
You enter a Viridian Design  contest by placing your entry
on a website, and sending the address to the moderator.
The site must be up for the length of the contest. The
winner of the contest receives a prize via snailmail.  The
prizes are modest:  generally classy books and/or nifty
gizmos.

language, be my guest.

"What's the difference between the Manifesto of January 3,
2000 and "The Manifesto of January 3, 2000"?
<P>
In October 1998, I gave a speech in San Francisco,
suggesting that January 3, 2000 would be a good time to
launch a manifesto and start a design movement.  That 1998
speech should henceforth be known as the "Viridian Design
Speech."  The actual Manifesto of January 3, 2000
appeared, just as predicted, on January 3, 2000.  It was a
call to people in all walks of life to put the bad habits
of the 20th century behind them, and to focus their
creative energies on the realities of a new historical
period.  My own response to my own 1/3/2000 pep-talk is to
stop writing novels and to devote the year 2000 to
activism.  After Jan 3, 2000, the Viridian Movement is no
longer my hobby but my central interest.
<P>
"There seem to be some heavy issues here. I'd like to get
into this at greater length than these Viridian email
essays.  But how?"
<P>
Start reading books on the subjects at hand.   We have
quite a few of the classics of ecological and industrial
design listed on<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/">http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/</A>
You can buy them immediately through our Amazon site. Get
them however you please; but we can testify from personal
experience that those books are worth reading and will not
waste your time.<BR>
We're always looking for more such worthy works.  If you
find a work that seems really up our alley, recommend it
to us.
<P>
If you yourself have written a book, we'd like to know
that, too, whether or not it's of direct relevance to
Viridian interests.
<P>
"What's the 'Viridian Curia?'"
<P>
They're people on Viridian list who've volunteered to
take part in off-line efforts such as Viridian T-shirts,
gizmos, magazine articles, etc.   They're hard-core
zealots who are willing to sacrifice more sustained
attention and effort than other, lesser Viridians.  Their
exalted status is marked with a bishop's crook (?).
<P>
"Got any T-shirts left?"
<P>
Yeah, a few.  They cost fifteen bucks.  I got a box of 'em
here at the Viridian Vatican.  Some day I may get around
to selling them on Amazon, but this physical meatspace
stuff is mighty daunting to us cyberspace cowboys.
<P>
"I found a really neat, eco-chic, high-tech-Green eco-toy
that all Viridians will doubtless lust to possess.  How
can I let everyone know about it without the utter
humiliation of resorting to commercial advertising?"
<P>
Have a look at:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.bespoke.org/viridian/catalog.asp">http://www.bespoke.org/viridian/catalog.asp</A>
<P>
This is where we recommend machines, products, gizmos,
stores and e-commerce sites.
<P>
"This doesn't have anything to do with your design
contests, but I'm designing something myself that seems
very Viridian. What now?"
<P>
Send in a web address for it.  If it seems relevant to our
interests, we'll list it as a "Viridian Individual
Project"  and post it to the list.  You will receive a
valuable and prestigious star (*).
<P>
"Why does every Viridian Note end with those O=c=O marks?"
<P>
Those are carbon dioxide molecules.  They're meant to
remind us that the Internet still runs on fossil fuels.
The fossil fuel vice is so deeply embedded that even our
email discussions haplessly contribute to the Greenhouse
Effect.   The reminder helps keep us focussed on our
central concern: we're wrecking the sky.
<P>
"How come dates are referred to in Viridian Notes with
an extra zero, like 'October 01998' and 'January 02000'?"
<P>
Stewart Brand of Long Now Foundation suggested that this
extra zero would be a good habit to break people loose
from the poverty of short-term thinking.  It suggests the
true depth of history that stretches, not merely behind
us, but ahead of us.
