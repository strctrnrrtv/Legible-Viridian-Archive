Local newspaper (Austin American-Statesman) weather
coverage in Austin, Texas, USA, July 31, 01999:
<P>
<P>
"The current heat wave has been linked to at least 93
deaths in 18 states across the country since July 19."
<P>
<P>
"Temperatures neared 100 degrees in many cities, and
the heat index == a measure of temperature and humidity ==
rose past 110 in several places.  The heat index neared
120 in Chicago."
<P>
<P>
"The misery was spread all over. It was 106 in
Louisville, Ky., one degree short of the city's record,
and 104 in Fort Knox. Kenosha, Wis., reached 102, and
Winona, Minn., reported a high of 99.  Nashville, Tenn.,
broke a record at 101."
<P>
<P>
"A prolonged dry spell has seized the East, withering
crops, feeding forest fires and sucking rivers and lakes
so dry that Baltimore has only a month's worth of drinking
water in its reservoirs.   Maryland declared the first
drought emergency in its  history Thursday, joining
Pennsylvania, New York, Delaware and scores of communities
in urging people and businesses to curb water use."
<P>
<P>
Conspicuous in its lack of appearance amidst this
weather havoc is the simple term "Greenhouse Effect."
One has to wonder:  why don't weather reporters simply own
up to the obvious?  After all, it's clearly hotter than
it's ever been before.  The effects are all over the
place.  The situation is historically unprecedented.
There must be some good reason why the weather's going
wild.
<P>
<P>
Well, there are also good reasons why the term
"Greenhouse Effect" goes unheard.   For one thing, there's
a large cabal of TV weathercasters, who, for anti-Kyoto
and anti-Clinton political reasons, have agreed never to
mention the subject on the air.

It's mighty public-spirited of these  high-minded
professionals to take the trouble to keep the rest of us
from panicking and stampeding.  That list of Leipzig
signatories may be handy in future show-trials, too.  Just
in case there are some genuine climatic urban
catastrophes.  In that case, some climate-politics
scapegoats will have to be found and ritually sacrificed,
in order to explain to a vengeful public why they were not
informed, and why statesmen didn't take action earlier,
while there was still time.  The people who signed this
list are pretty much perfect for that role.  And once they
realize this, that's when they're really going to freak.
<P>
<P>
As the Greenhouse evidence continues to mount, we
can expect ever more frantic and ever better financed
efforts at denial.  The many and various Greenhouse denial
operations == Global Climate Coalition, Greening Earth
Society, Western Fuels, Cato Institute, Claremont
Institute, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Committee for
a Constructive Tomorrow, George C. Marshall Institute,
Heartland Institute, etc etc == are sunk in ideological
concrete.  They've burned their bridges, and now large
sections of the planet are catching fire.  They are pretty
much bound to become more aggressive, fanatical and
panicky as the consequences of their operations bear their
evil fruit.
<P>
<P>
However, time is on the side of the weather
alarmists.  Because the freakish anomalies will just keep
piling up.  One of the best lists of Greenhouse atrocities
is Ross Gelbspan's, at
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.heatisonline.org/weather.cfm">http://www.heatisonline.org/weather.cfm</A>
<P>
<P>
Blistering Indians, drowned Bangladeshis, heat-and-
smoke crazed New Guineans running amuck == imagine how
that list is going to look ten years from now!
<P>
<P>
I feel that we Viridians should also pitch in, by
compiling our own, unique, Weather Violence list.  It's
too easy to list the big disasters == and it's not
psychologically effective.  The public is already inured
to massive weather deaths in Bangladesh.  The Bangladeshis
themselves are sunk into fatalism and out of the running.
After all, if these dying Third Worlders had any
organization skill and political clout, they would have
decent emergency rescue services on-site.  Just like the
G-7 countries do for all their own weather emergencies.
<P>
<P>
American weather casualties are a more compelling
topic for the Viridian target audience, but although the
American elderly have plenty of clout and influence, the
poor elderly don't.  Besides, 90 or so weather casualties
across the whole USA is just not much of a death-rate.
Those heat-stricken corpses are as nothing compared to the
major-war-scaled hecatombs sacrificed by American industry
with cigarettes and traffic collisions.  And the carbon
industry is much, much bigger than cigarettes.  Plus, it
feeds almost all the cars.
<P>
<P>
So the carbon industries needn't fear a loss of
hundreds of dead, or even thousands of dead, every summer.
Those who die are unable to find air conditioning, much
less successfully lobby the Congress.   Besides, giant
floods, vast fires, savage droughts, massive avalanches,
these events have been part of the repertoire of global
climatic behavior from time immemorial. The villains can
simply brazen it out.
<P>
<P>
What we Viridians need to contribute to this stifled
debate is a documented database of specialized *Viridian
Disasters."  In other words, disasters with a visionary,
glamorous, historically unprecedented twist == disasters
that <b>smell like the twenty-first century.</b>
<P>
<P>
Take this bizarre toxin of alarm, for instance,
thoughtfully sent in by Alan Wexelblat,
(wex@media.mit.edu^^^^^^^^^^^^^^****?).
<P>
<P>
Alan Wexelblat perceptively remarks:  "I don't have
a word for this form of disaster, but I bet we see a lot
of them in the "00s.":
<P>

<P>
Fecal Explosion Threatens City
<P>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (Reuters) 06/10/1996.  The
Honduran capital faces possible violent explosions of
fecal matter due to massive obstructions in its sewage
system, officials said Wednesday.
<P>
<P>
"We are racing against time to unblock the pipes
before winter comes and the pipes and manholes overflow or
explode," said Humberto Puerto, manager of the National
Aqueduct and Sewerage Network Service.
<P>
<P>
"There are tanks that are full of fecal matter and
that could explode because of the gases being produced and
the pressure of new fluids," he told reporters.
<P>
<P>
The sewerage network in Honduran capital Tegucigalpa,
a city of more than 1 million people, has sustained severe
cracks and mounting blockages caused by Hurricane Mitch,
which devastated the impoverished Central American country
in October 1998.
<P>
<P>
Fecal matter and urine have been running openly
through city streets due to the blockages in underground
pipelines. (...)
<P>
<BR>
<P>
Alan Wexelblat further remarks: "Assuming this event
is not sui generis, it seems to me we need to find a way
to talk about (name?) this class of disasters.
<P>
"Criteria:<BR>
"* A man-made system related to carbon-spewing lifestyle
"* Human technical infrastructure exploited past the
limits of its capacity<BR>
"* Additional stresses placed on system by unnatural
climate processes
<P>
"Result = Viridian Disaster.
<P>
<P>
"Hurricane Mitch is not in this disaster class in and
of itself.  These Viridian Disaster events will be
infrastructural in nature, rather than merely external.
They'll be collapse, implosion, failure type events,
rather than explosive, razing type events.  The technical
system will tie itself in knots, because the planet really
is <strong>much</strong> bigger/more powerful than these systems were
designed to accept."
<P>
<P>
Alan makes some interesting conceptual points here,
but I believe his definition is too narrow.  There's
another class of event that also deserves ardent
cataloguing in the repertoire of Viridian propaganda,
because of its psychological-operations effectiveness.
These are 21st century unnatural weather events that are
<strong>unheimlich</strong> and uncanny.  They are important because they
directly affect the rich and powerful.  They have weird
overtones of contamination, filth, and unpredictable,
universal menace == regardless of one's wealth, dwelling
locale, political connections or social status.  This
event, for instance:

Algae blooms visible from  space
<P>
<P>
The algae is moving west
<P>
<P>
Scientists are tracking the progress of a giant mass
of algae which is causing the sea to change colour off the
south-west coast of England.
<P>
<P>
The bloom is the size of Cornwall and is visible from
space as a white-coloured mass stretching from south Devon
to the Scilly Isles and  moving west.
<P>
<P>
It has been caused by a rapidly expanding microscopic
plant, Emiliania huxleyi.
<P>
<P>
This sheds its chalky outer layers, colouring the
sea turquoise or milky blue.
<P>
<P>
'Harmless but unusual'
<P>
<P>
Experts at Plymouth Marine Laboratory say it is
harmless but unusually close to shore and was triggered by
hot, calm weather.
<P>
<P>
Local fishermen say they have never seen anything
like it.
<P>
<P>
One skipper, Douglas Pooley, said: "It was like
something out of a science fiction movie. We steamed about
eight miles and we were in amongst it all the time."
<P>
<P>
Another man who steered his boat through the bloom
said: "It's like sailing through milk."
<P>
<P>
If only Prince Charles had happened to sail his
yacht through this massive, uncanny blob!  But rest easy
== some day that will happen.  We'll have the celebrity
Rock Hudsons of the Greenhouse Effect, the carbon
Chernobyls and carbon Three Mile Islands.  We Viridians
must be alert for these events, and make it our business
to promote them.
<P>
<P>
We are looking for disasters that possess this
haunting, poetic, attention-seizing, paradigmatic quality.
Viridian Disasters must provoke the resonant, creepy
feeling one has when one realizes that every scrap of the
planet's atmosphere has been defiled by the carbon-mining
industries  (and that the seas are following suit).
<P>
      <P> The carbon-miners will not go easily == because they already saw what 
        happened to the nuclear people. They can be counted on to fight to the 
        end. The keynote we Viridians are searching for is not the body count, 
        but a skin-creeping, bone-deep aesthetic revulsion against the Greenhouse 
        and all its works.
