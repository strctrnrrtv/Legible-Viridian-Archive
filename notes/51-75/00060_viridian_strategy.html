        funny and they have weird news clippings, then you앇 better skip this

      <p>A woman who makes pottery out of deep-sea abyssal mud. Teakettles anyone? 
      </p>
      <p>After the Viridian Teakettle Contest, I have had some time to ponder 
        Viridian imaginary products and possible Viridian events. </p>
      <p>I believe we Viridians have hit a nerve with this imaginary products 
        theme. The response is strong. Viridian Notes with "imaginary products" 
        provoke a lot of list feedback. They also stir up media interest. </p>
      <p>Grim reportage of melting Antarctic ice packs is all well and good, but 
        were preaching to the converted as we track the climate news. These made-up 
        gizmos of ours, by contrast, really seem to suit the contemporary temperament. 
        It압 an age which is profoundly weary of ideology and hates to face the 
        facts, but it압 still touchingly eager for a technical fix, especially 
        if it압 personal, intimate, and can be FedExed in with a single website 
        click. </p>
      <p>So I앇 like to see the Viridian Movement invest some serious effort in 
        this promising direction. Expressing one압 desire for righteous knicknacks 
        is an effective political tactic, much less shopworn than protest signs, 
        peptalks, or dire prognostications. </p>
      <p>I believe our tactics here should echo those of the Canadian publication 
        ADBUSTERS. ADBUSTERS violently loathes the advertising industry and all 
        its works. A typical ADBUSTERS fake ad is "Joe Chemo," a chainsmoking 
        camel undergoing chemotherapy. The uniform subtext of all ADBUSTERS fake 
        ads is that you, the viewer, are a victim of mental pollution and corporate 
        false-consciousness. ADBUSTERS tries to hammer you into a more socially- 
        advanced awareness by revealing the machineries of consumer manipulation. 
      </p>
      <p>This is doubtless a virtuous and useful message, but there압 already 
        a group energetically doing this, ie. ADBUSTERS. Given our limited resources 
        and innate Viridian Inactivism, we lazy Viridians could never out-do ADBUSTERS. 
      </p>
      <p>However, I think we could detourne advertising in another way. Our Viridian 
        version of fake ads should strongly suggest to the viewer that he lives 
        in an <i>entire culture</i> which is so crass, so crude, so filthy, 
        and so lacking in refinement, that he or she is being <i>cruelly denied</i> 
        these very valuable and attractive consumer items. Viridian Imaginary 
        Products should look as luscious, guilt-free and enticing as possible. 
        Theyre utterly wonderful -- cheap, too! </p>
      <p>So, we Viridians do NOT want to urge the pampered consumer to behave 
        in a more adult, reponsible fashion, consuming less, consuming correctly, 
        and spending more time in (for instance) sprout-eating and transcendental 
        meditation. No, our basic intent here is to provoke a trance-rupturing 
        <i>consumer tantrum.</i> Our intent with these fake ads is to <i>push 
        the contradictions</i> -- to exacerbate an atmosphere of consumer hysteria. 
      </p>
      <p>We Viridians want consumers to be instantly afflicted with a terrible, 
        tantalized greed for these marvelous items that they s<i>imply cannot 
        possess.</i> This is because Viridian imaginary products are, by their 
        very nature, products inherent to a <i>superior and more advanced 21st 
        century civilization.</i> Stupid 20th-century cultures vilely smothering 
        in their own CO2 trash cannot manufacture items this cool. Desire that 
        item, therefore, and you find yourself, will-nilly, desiring some better 
        culture. </p>
      <p>As an important corollary, we want actual, contemporary product manufacturers 
        to suffer severe pangs of future-shock and competitive anxiety when they 
        see our imaginary ads. That압 because our imaginary ads make all their 
        actual, real-life, coal-powered products <i>look really bad and ugly.</i> 
      </p>
      <p>Now, if we had a sufficient number of these imaginary ads in production, 
        we could assemble an entire Viridian Imaginary Products Catalog. I surmise 
        that this publication would look and act rather like a SHARPER IMAGE catalog, 
        only, well, very Viridian. This catalog would be a visionary work of science 
        fiction (without of course, identifying itself as "science fiction" in 
        any way). In order to get it into as many hands as possible, we would 
        sell it commercially. It would probably be retailed in alternative bookstores, 
        fanzine outlets, by mail-order, and so forth. </p>
      <p>If this publication created useful interest and did not bankrupt our 
        so-called organization, then a Viridian Exhibit would be in order. We 
        would create mock-ups and models of our Imaginary Products, and take the 
        show on the road. Like the magazine, this would be a commercial effort. 
        Entry fees would be charged in host galleries, and, to cover our costs, 
        it is quite likely that the fake products would be auctioned off to eager 
        sci-fi collectors at the end of the event. </p>
      <p>Should we reach this exalted, ambitious stage, many further opportunities 
        beckon. Personally, I would probably write a Viridian book. Other Viridian 
        spinoffs by other Viridians seem plausible. At this point, the term "Viridian" 
        would probably go into public domain. There would be press coverage, and 
        bandwagon hopping, and many derivative rip-offs, and perhaps some actual 
        real-life working artifacts, and basically, we would be witnessing an 
        authentic little 21st century design movement, leaping up from deep obscurity 
        to wreak whatever temporary havoc these things can. </p>
      <p>To get there from here requires cumulative steps. Given our narrow resource 
        base, any misstep can do us serious harm, and the first and most important 
        misstep, I believe, would be muddying the waters between the Internet 
        gift economy and for-profit activity. It is fatally easy to cause great 
        ill-will by mishandling this issue. For instance, this is likely to happen 
        when Grandma gives you a bicycle out of the loving goodness of her kindly 
        heart, and she spots you flogging her bike for cash in a flea market, 
        one week later. At that point, even the kindliest of Grandmas is likely 
        to whip out her umbrella and lay into you. And justly so. </p>
      <p>Much can be done outside the money economy. I앐 a great believer in distributed 
        systems and gift economies. But magazines, and especially, gallery shows, 
        just don앖 work without funding. </p>
      <p>A natural dividing line suggests itself, however. Inside cyberspace: 
        outside cyberspace. This will be our operating principle. Inside the Net, 
        we will continue the Viridian List just as it has gone to date: it will 
        be done entirely with noncommercial cajoling, ideological exhortations, 
        prestigious dingbats for your log-in name, and occasional cool art-books 
        as door prizes. </p>
      <p>However, when it comes to moving atoms rather than bits: say, layout, 
        shipping, publishing, and making Viridian rayguns out of Fimo, we need 
        to be on a firm commercial basis. In other words, I plan to pay contributors. 
        Not very much, I hasten to add. Just barely enough to convince you that 
        you are not being baldly ripped-off. </p>
      <p>If "Viridianism" ever somehow becomes truly "fashionable," then somebody 
        somewhere, very likely including me, is going to get a lot of money. In 
        the culture industry, if you make any perceptible cultural difference, 
        you will definitely be burdened with a lot of money, whether you want 
        it or not. I have witnessed this happening hundreds of times to hundreds 
        of people. They always seem surprised about it, but that압 because theyre 
        artists, and nobody ever trained them to think ahead. This is the stark 
        operational reality of recuperative, co- optational capitalism. We Viridians 
        have just got to get used to that dynamic and its consequences, because 
        if we buckle under such an elementary gambit, we don앖 deserve to live. 
      </p>
      <p>If, in future, you somehow make a lot of money because you got famous 
        in the "Viridian Movement," I would suggest that you blow it on better 
        software, strange artwork and cool designer crap. Then you앏l be broke 
        again, and just as lean, mean, and virtuous as you were before, except 
        your apartment will be full of cool weird furniture. Somebody압 gotta 
        keep Philippe Starck in business, you know. </p>
      <p>Now: we will have some time to ponder and debate these matters. This 
        spring, I앐 very busy completing a novel. But once summer is here in Texas, 
        I expect to be working on Viridian issues with much intensity. Because 
        I expect to endure an extremely, lethally hot Texan summer this year. 
        I앏l be spending a lot of time hunched over my computer in the laboring 
        air conditioning, grimly waiting for big swathes of Mexico to catch fire. 
      </p>
      <p>I welcome your feedback on this matter of imaginary products. Specifically, 
        I would like to create four lists of Viridian volunteers. </p>
      <p>A. People who want to work on these advertisements and the catalog, with 
        the firm understanding that this is a for-hire, piecework-style, design 
        job. Because we need these fake ads to look <i>good.</i> We want them 
        to intrigue and alarm normal people who read real, no-kidding magazines. 
        A billboard or two likely wouldn앖 kill us, either. </p>
      <p>B. Youre not a copywriter, designer or graphics type, but you앇 like 
        to take on some of the organizational work, such as shipping stuff around 
        and bugging total strangers to meet deadlines. It압 awful, unglamorous 
        drudgery. We앏l pick up your postage costs and probably give you, I dunno, 
        a Big Mike sweatshirt or something. </p>
      <p>C. People who are too damn lazy do any work for us, but who have lots 
        of money, and want to give some to us so we can create mischief with it. 
        If one of you software moguls on this list wants to pony up ten grand, 
        for instance, I can guarantee you some entertaining fireworks by the end 
        of summer. </p>
      <p>D. Modelmakers, gallerists and other fellow-travellers. </p>
      <p>Send email if you think you are up to tackling this. </p>
      <p>The next Viridian Note will have a new design contest, for a very nifty 
        new prize. </p>
