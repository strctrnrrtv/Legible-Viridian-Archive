      <p><b>Viridian 
        Notes 301-350</b>
      <ul>

<li> <a href="351-400/00351_decaying_media.html" >00351: Decaying Media</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>It's really a "Dead Media
Project" note disguised as a Viridian Note.]</li>
<li> <a href="351-400/00352_bug_news.html" >00352: Bug News</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>continues the
long-standing Viridian obsession with single-celled
organisms.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00353_holiday_cheer.html" >00353: Holiday Cheer</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>You can come over
here for New Years and witness our renewably-powered
Xmas display.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00354_paging-thomas_gold.html" >00354: Paging Thomas Gold</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>a note researched
and written by Michael Semer, a Viridian who took
the trouble to actually talk to Dr. Thomas Gold.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00355_more_biosphere_bugs.html" >00355: More Biopshere Bugs</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Science journalist Oliver
Morton weighs in on the subject of strange new notions of
single-celled life.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00356_the_year_in_review.html" >00356: The Year in Review</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>It's a political
assessment of the past year in global affairs.  Over 2,500
words. Might be considered somewhat contrarian as it is
Canadian and fails to chew over the usual sets of
shibboleths.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00357_tomorrow_now_tour.html" >00357: Tomorrow Now Tour</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>The obligatory
labor of stoking the starmaker machinery.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00358_canberra_in_flames.html" >00358: Canberra in Flames</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>You'd think it
would be a big "national security issue" if your capital
city was on fire, but, oddly, nobody seems to spin it
that way.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00359_canberra_flames_subside.html" >00359: Canberra Flames Subside</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Various interested
Viridian parties weigh in on the subject of the recent
fires around the capital of Australia.  Over 2,700
words.  The earlier note was painful, ugly and scary,
but this one is worse. Large numbers of dense, brain-
clogging links.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00360_venezuelas_curse.html" >00360: Venezuela's Curse</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>A FORTUNE magazine
article points out that carbon mining has ruined
Venezuela.  But why wasn't this helpful tip delivered much
earlier?  And what about all those other formerly
prosperous countries massively harmed  by corrupt carbon
domination in their centers of government?   Not that
we're naming any names.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00361_beautiful_things.html" >00361: Beautiful Things</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>  Could keep you
websurfing for months on end.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00362_the_mood_at_davos.html" >00362: The Mood at Davos</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>  It's charming personal
gossip about the rich and powerful that the gossiper
didn't intend for us to hear.  So I feel kind of bad about
letting on to it to 1,800+ people.  On the other hand,
Viridians need to hear this, so that you can go buy
duct tape, survival weapons and bags of rice.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00363_sxsw_interactive.html" >00363: SXSW Interactive</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> Involves free beer!  You're invited!]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00364_pretty_butterflies.html" >00364: Pretty Butterflies</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> Deliberately makes no
mention whatsoever of desert warfare, raging street
protests, or giant thermobaric bombs.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00365_pope_appears_on_earth_day.html" >00365: Pope Appears on Earth Day</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> News primarily of local
Austin interest.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00366_embrace_the_decay_contest.html" >00366: Embrace the Decay Contest</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> It's yet another in a
series of Viridian contests.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00367_here_comes_planetwork.html" >00367: Here Comes PlaNetwork</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> I really want to go
and I can't, so you should go.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00368_more_involuntary_parks.html" >00368: More Involuntary Parks</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> Part of a flurry
of Viridian Notes, as we catch up on backlog.
This won't last long.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00369_windpower_03.html" >00369: Windpower '03</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> It's very windy.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00370_embracing_decay.html" >00370: Embracing Decay</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> Finally, some
contest entries.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00371_hex_on_exxon.html" >00371: Hex on Exxon</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> it's political.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00372_ted_saves_the_world.html" >00372: Ted Saves the World</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> Lots of links.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00373_microengines.html" >00373: Microengines</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> Includes a party invite to the Viridian Vatican.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00374_viridian_beer-tasting.html" >00374: Viridian Beer-Tasting</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Announces
winner of our latest contest.  Wind-powered or no,
excessive beer consumption can cause one to wreck large
fossil-fueled vehicles.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00375_mass_dieback.html" >00375: Mass Dieback</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Probably
the least satisfying "I told you so" experience
that a Viridian might have.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00376_europe_burns.html" >00376: Europe Burns</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Is the human
race too stupid to live?  This mayhem should be
front-page news every day. 2,349 words of
a whole continent in heavy weather.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00377_viridian_commentary.html" >00377: Viridian Commentary</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Lengthy accounts
by various interested Viridian parties on the morale-
denting mayhem of weather violence.  Almost 2,500 words.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00378_british_involuntary_park.html" >00378: British Involuntary Park</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Scarcely mentions
the temperature breaking 100 degrees  F in Britain,
or the "carloads of dead" from the unnatural heat in
Paris.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00379_blackouts_and_diebacks.html" >00379: Blackouts and Diebacks</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Conflates
a number of different Greenhouse phenomena
into a  3,250-word screed.  Grim, glum, scary,
savagely partisan.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00380_so_long_mont_blanc.html" >00380: So Long Mont Blanc</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Likely
to cause sensations of dread.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00381_starvation.html" >00381: Starvation</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Nothing new about
environmental activists hand-wringing over prospects of
mass starvation.  Kinda new to wonder if this might go
from the unthinkable to a real-life truism in such
short order, though.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00382_wavefront_newsletter.html" >00382: WaveFront Newsletter</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>includes the entire text
of a lengthy, multiply-linked newsletter written by
somebody else == a work that is annotated even further and
festooned with extra, attention-hungry links.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00383_silent_coup_at_epa.html" >00383: Silent Coup at EPA</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Involves the increasingly
noisome subject of domestic American politics.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00384_climate_prediction_net.html" >00384: Climate Prediction Net</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Software not available for
Mac or Linux, so hapless climate predictors are likely to
be wrecked at random intervals by Microsoft-based viruses
and worms.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00385_popes_vacation_pix.html" >00385: Pope's Vacation Pix</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>is there anything in
the world more boring than some guy showing you
his vacation photos?]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00386_house_party.html" >00386: House Party</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Basically an invitation to drop by and drink beer. Lots of semi-random links.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00387_australian_super_drought.html" >00387: Australian Super Drought</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Who cares about
the miserable fate of doomed Australia? I'm going to
Norway and Holland, starting tomorrow!]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00388_eerie_revival_of_dead_media.html" >00388: The Eerie Revival of Dead Media</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>has nothing to
do with environmental issues, even though a
patch of California the size of Rhode Island
is on fire.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00389_beyond_the_blog.html" >00389: Beyond the Beyond Blog</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>yet more about
the Pope-Emperor's non-Viridian activities; involves
weblogs, notoriously an effort in which other
people have to do all the work.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00390_drowning_in_mecca.html" >00390: Drowning in Mecca</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>New English-language 
news sources seem to care much that Mecca is briefly subaqueous.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00391_another_world_is_here.html" >00391: Another World is Here</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>You should definitely
take the time to read this Note.  This is good news of
high importance to the Viridian scene.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00392_the_look_of_tech_nouveau.html" >00392: The Look of Tech Nouveau</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Nice pics.  Also includes 
  a cheery invite to a Viridian Vatican party this weekend.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00393_more_look_of_tech_nouveau.html" >00393: More Look of Tech Nouveau</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Nice pics.  Leans heavily on a 
new Victoria and Albert Museum show and a spectacular 
new book by British-American design journalist Hugh Aldersey-Williams.  Lots of links.  
Basically a huge
primer on the kind of look the Viridian Movement most 
wants to promulgate.  Could prove hugely time-consuming. 
You might spend the rest of your life living in stuff 
shaped like this.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00394_the_smart_energy_industry.html" >00394: The Smart Energy Industry</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>of primary interest to
clean energy wonks. Lots of irrelevant but entertaining
links.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00395_weather_futures_market.html" >00395: Weather Futures Market</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Concerns peculiar vagaries
of contemporary capitalism; includes some mind-deadening
biz-jargon.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00396_jolly_news_for_the_new_year.html" >00396: Jolly News for the New Year</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Errs on the side of
the life-affirming in a frank attempt to keep
people's hopes up.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00397_attention_conservation.html" >00397: Attention Conservation</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Viridian List getting
a bit meta here with a note about attention conservation.

and ability to concentrate.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00398_desperate_climate_remediation_schemes.html" >00398: Desperate Climate Remediation Schemes</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Consists mostly of Viridian
black humor about a well-meaning conference of Anglo-American

annotated text of a conference dot-pdf.]</li>

<li> <a href="351-400/00399_dead_nations_on_internet.html" >00399: Dead Nations on Internet</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Darkly whimsical

  has been traveling for weeks.  This Note clears out a
