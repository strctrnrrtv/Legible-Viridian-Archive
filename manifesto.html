<b>
      <p>The Manifesto of January 3, 2000</p>
      </b>
      <p>by Bruce Sterling</p>
       
      <p>The rapidly approaching millennium offers a unique cultural opportunity. 
        After many years of cut-and-paste, appropriation, detournement and neo-retro 
        ahistoricality, postmodernity is about to end. Immediately after the end 
        of the fin de siecle, there will be a sudden and intense demand for genuine 
        novelty.</p>
      <p>Any new year offers a chance for sweeping resolutions and brave efforts 
        at self-reform. But the end of a millennium offers a rare and vital opportunity 
        to bury all that is dead within us and issue proclamations of particular 
        scope and ambition.</p>
      <p>I suspect that a group that can offer a coherent, thoughtful and novel 
        cultural manifesto on the target date of January 3, 2000 has a profound 
        opportunity to affect the zeitgeist. (On January 1, everyone will be too 
        hung over to read manifestos; on January 2, nobody's computers will work. 
        So naturally the target date must be January 3.) In this preliminary document, 
        I would like to offer a few thoughts on the possible contents of such 
        a manifesto.</p>
      <p>The central issue as the new millennium dawns is technocultural. There 
        are of course other, more traditional, better-developed issues for humankind. 
        Cranky fundamentalism festers here and there; the left is out of ideas 
        while the right is delusional; income disparities have become absurdly 
        huge; these things are obvious to all. However, the human race has repeatedly 
        proven that we can prosper cheerfully with ludicrous, corrupt and demeaning 
        forms of religion, politics and commerce. By stark contrast, no civilization 
        can survive the physical destruction of its resource base. It is very 
        clear that the material infrastructure of the twentieth century is not 
        sustainable. This is the issue at hand.</p>
      <p>We have a worldwide environmental problem. This is a truism. But the 
        unprecedentedly severe and peculiar weather of the late 1990s makes it 
        clear that this problem is growing acute. Global warming has been a lively 
        part of scientific discussion since at least the 1960s, but global warming 
        is a quotidian reality now. Climate change is shrouding the globe in clouds 
        of burning rain forest and knocking points off the GNP of China. Everyone 
        can offer a weird weather anecdote now; for instance, I spent a week this 
        summer watching the sky turn gray with fumes from the blazing forests 
        of Chiapas. The situation has been visibly worsening, and will get worse 
        yet, possibly very much worse.</p>
      <p>Society has simply been unable to summon the political or economic will 
        to deal successfully with this problem by using 20th century methods. 
        That is because CO2 emission is not centrally a political or economic 
        problem. It is a design and engineering problem. It is a cultural problem 
        and a problem of artistic sensibility.</p>
      <p>New and radical approaches are in order. These approaches should be originated, 
        gathered, martialled into an across-the-board cultural program, and publicly 
        declared -- on January 3rd.</p>
      <p>Global warming is a profound opportunity for the 21st century culture 
        industry. National governments lack the power and the will to impose dirigiste 
        solutions to the emission of carbon dioxide. Dirigiste solutions would 
        probably not work anyway. It is unlikely that many of us could tolerate 
        living in a carbon-dioxide Ration State. It would mean that almost every 
        conceivable human activity would have to be licensed by energy commissars.</p>
      <p>Industry will not reform its energy base. On the contrary, when it comes 
        to CO2 legislation, industry will form pressure groups and throw as much 
        sand as possible into the fragile political wheels. Industry will use 
        obscurantist tactics that will mimic those of American right-wing anti-evolution 
        forces -- we will be told that Global Warming is merely a "theory," even 
        when our homes are on fire. Industry is too stupid to see planetary survival 
        as a profit opportunity. But industry is more than clever enough to sabotage 
        government regulation, especially when globalized industry can play one 
        government off against the next.</p>
      <p>The stark fact that our atmosphere is visibly declining is of no apparent 
        economic interest except to insurance firms, who will simply make up their 
        lack by gouging ratepayers and exporting externalized costs onto the general 
        population.</p>
      <p>With business hopeless and government stymied, we are basically left 
        with cultural activism. The tools at hand are art, design, engineering, 
        and basic science: human artifice, cultural and technical innovation. 
        Granted, these may not seem particularly likely sources of a serious and 
        successful effort to save the world. This is largely because, during the 
        twentieth century, government and industry swelled to such tremendous 
        high-modernist proportions that these other enterprises exist mostly in 
        shrunken subcultural niches.</p>
      <p>However, this doesn't have to be the case. With government crippled and 
        industry brain-dead to any conceivable moral appeal, the future of decentered, 
        autonomous cultural networks looks very bright. There has never been an 
        opportunity to spread new ideas and new techniques with the alacrity that 
        they can spread now. Human energy must turn in some direction. People 
        will run from frustration and toward any apparent source of daylight. 
        As the planet's levees continue to break, people will run much faster 
        and with considerably more conviction.</p>
      <p>Our cultural substance-abuse problem with CO2 may have very severe consequences 
        to human happiness, but the immediate physical problem is rather well 
        understood. Clever people, united and motivated, should be able to deal 
        with this. Carbon dioxide is not a time-honored philosophical dilemma 
        or some irreducible flaw in the human condition. Serious fossil-fuel consumption, 
        as a practice on the grand scale, is only about 200 years old. The most 
        severe rise in carbon emission occurred during the past fifty years. We're 
        painfully dependent on this practice, but it's not as if we've married 
        it.</p>
      <p>It's a question of tactics. Civil society does not respond at all well 
        to moralistic scolding. There are small minority groups here and there 
        who are perfectly aware that it is immoral to harm the lives of coming 
        generations by massive consumption now: deep Greens, Amish, people practicing 
        voluntary simplicity, Gandhian ashrams and so forth. These public-spirited 
        voluntarists are not the problem. But they're not the solution either, 
        because most human beings won't volunteer to live like they do. Nor can 
        people be forced to live that way through legal prescription, because 
        those in command of society's energy resources will immediately game and 
        neutralize any system of legal regulation.</p>
      <p>However, contemporary civil society can be led anywhere that looks attractive, 
        glamorous and seductive.</p>
      <p>The task at hand is therefore basically an act of social engineering. 
        Society must become Green, and it must be a variety of Green that society 
        will eagerly consume. What is required is not a natural Green, or a spiritual 
        Green, or a primitivist Green, or a blood-and-soil romantic Green.</p>
      <p>These flavors of Green have been tried, and have proven to have insufficient 
        appeal. We can regret this failure if we like. If the semi-forgotten Energy 
        Crisis of the 1970s had provoked a wiser and more energetic response, 
        we would not now be facing a weather crisis. But the past's well-meaning 
        attempts were insufficient, and are now part of the legacy of a dying 
        century.</p>
      <p>The world needs a new, unnatural, seductive, mediated, glamorous Green. 
        A Viridian Green, if you will.</p>
      <p>The best chance for progress is to convince the twenty-first century 
        that the twentieth century's industrial base was crass, gauche, and filthy. 
        This approach will work because it is based in the truth. The twentieth 
        century lived in filth. It was much like the eighteenth century before 
        the advent of germ theory, stricken by septic cankers whose origins were 
        shrouded in superstition and miasma. The truth about our physical existence 
        must be shown to people. It must be demonstrated repeatedly and everywhere.</p>
      <p>People with networks, websites and sophisticated sensors should not find 
        this task very difficult.</p>
      <p>The current industrial base is outmoded, crass and nasty, but this is 
        not yet entirely obvious. Scolding it and brandishing the stick is just 
        part of the approach. Proving it requires the construction of an alternative 
        twenty-first century industrial base which seems elegant, beautiful and 
        refined. This effort should not be portrayed as appropriate, frugal, and 
        sensible, even if it is. It must be perceived as glamorous and visionary. 
        It will be very good if this new industrial base actually functions, but 
        it will work best if it is spectacularly novel and beautiful. If it is 
        accepted, it can be made to work; if it is not accepted, it will never 
        have a chance to work.</p>
      <p>The central target for this social engineering effort must be the people 
        who are responsible for emitting the most CO2. The people we must strive 
        to affect are the ultrarich. The rentiers, the virtual class, the captains 
        of industry; and, to a lesser extent, the dwindling middle classes. The 
        poor will continue to suffer. There is clearly no pressing reason for 
        most human beings to live as badly and as squalidly as they do. But the 
        poor do not emit much carbon dioxide, so our efforts on their behalf can 
        only be tangential.</p>
      <p>Unlike the modernist art movements of the twentieth century, a Viridian 
        culture-industry movement cannot be concerned with challenging people's 
        aesthetic preconceptions. We do not have the 19th-century luxury of shocking 
        the bourgeoisie. That activity, enjoyable and time-honored though it is, 
        will not get that poison out of our air. We are attempting to survive 
        by causing the wealthy and the bourgeoisie to willingly live in a new 
        way.</p>
      <p>We cannot make them do it, but if we focussed our efforts, we would have 
        every prospect of luring them into it.</p>
      <p>What is culturally required at the dawn of the new millennium is a genuine 
        avant-garde, in the sense of a cultural elite with an advanced sensibility 
        not yet shared by most people, who are creating a new awareness requiring 
        a new mode of life. The task of this avant-garde is to design a stable 
        and sustainable physical economy in which the wealthy and powerful will 
        prefer to live. Mao suits for the masses are not on the Viridian agenda. 
        Couture is on the agenda. We need a form of Green high fashion so appallingly 
        seductive and glamorous that it can literally save people's lives. We 
        have to gratify people's desires much better than the current system does. 
        We have to reveal to people the many desires they have that the current 
        system is not fulfilling. Rather than marshalling themselves for inhuman 
        effort and grim sacrifice, people have to sink into our twenty-first century 
        with a sigh of profound relief.</p>
      <p>Allow me to speak hypothetically now, as if this avant-garde actually 
        existed, although, as we all know, it cannot possibly come into being 
        until January 3, 2000. Let's discuss our tactics. I have a few cogent 
        suggestions to offer.</p>
      <p>We can increase our chances of success by rapidly developing and expanding 
        the postmodern culture industry. Genuine "Culture" has "art" and "thought," 
        while the Culture Industry merely peddles images and information.</p>
      <p>I know this. I am fully aware of the many troubling drawbacks of this 
        situation, but on mature consideration, I think that the Culture Industry 
        has many profound advantages over the twentieth century's physically poisonous 
        smokestack industries. Also, as digital technologists, thinkers, writers, 
        designers, cultural critics, und so weiter, we Viridians suspect that 
        the rise of the Culture Industry is bound to increase our own immediate 
        power and influence vis-a-vis, say, coal mining executives. This may not 
        be an entirely good thing. However, we believe we will do the world less 
        immediate damage than they are doing.</p>
      <p>We therefore loudly demand that the Culture Industry be favored as a 
        suitably twenty-first century industrial enterprise. Luckily the trend 
        is already very much with us here, but we must go further; we believe 
        in Fordism in the Culture Industry. This means, by necessity, leisure. 
        Large amounts of leisure are required to appreciate and consume cultural-industrial 
        products such as movies, software, semi-functional streaming media and 
        so on. Time spent at more traditional forms of work unfairly lures away 
        the consumers of the Culture Industry, and therefore poses a menace to 
        our postindustrial economic underpinnings.</p>
      <p>"Work" requires that people's attention to be devoted to other, older, 
        less attractive industries. "Leisure" means they are paying attention 
        and money to us.</p>
      <p>We therefore demand much more leisure for everyone. Leisure for the unemployed, 
        while copious, is not the kind of "leisure" that increases our profits. 
        We specifically demand intensive leisure for well-educated, well-heeled 
        people. These are the people who are best able to appreciate and consume 
        truly capital-intensive cultural products.</p>
      <p>We Viridians suspect that it would require very little effort to make 
        people work much less. Entirely too much effort is being spent working. 
        We very much doubt that there is anything being done in metal-bending 
        industry today that can justify wrecking the atmosphere. We need to burn 
        the planetary candle at one end only (and, in daylight, not at all).</p>
      <p>As much time as possible should be spent consuming immaterial products. 
        A global population where the vast majority spend their time sitting still 
        and staring into screens is a splendid society for our purposes. Their 
        screens should be beautifully designed and their surroundings energy-efficient. 
        The planet will benefit for everyone who clicks a mouse instead of shovelling 
        coal or taking an axe and a plow to a rain forest.</p>
      <p>The tourist industry is now the number one industry on the planet. Tourists 
        consume large amounts of pre-packaged culture. We believe tourism to be 
        a profoundly healthy development. We feel we must strongly resist the 
        retrograde and unprofitable urge to make migrants and migration illegal.</p>
      <p>Given the unstable condition of the environment, this practice may soon 
        become tantamount to genocide. It is also palpably absurd to live in a 
        society where capital can move faster and more easily than human beings. 
        Capital exists for the sake and convenience of human beings.</p>
      <p>We believe that the movement of human beings across national boundaries 
        and under the aegis of foreign governments is basically a design problem. 
        If guest workers, refugees, pleasure travellers and so forth were all 
        electronically tracked via satellite or cell repeaters, the artificial 
        division between jet setters and refugees would soon cease to exist. Foreigners 
        are feared not merely because they are foreign, but because they are unknown, 
        unidentified, and apparently out of local social control.</p>
      <p>In the next century, foreigners need be none of these things. Along with 
        their ubiquitous credit cards and passports, they could carry their entire 
        personal histories. They could carry devices establishing proof of their 
        personal bona fides that would be immediately obvious to anyone in any 
        language. A better designed society would accommodate this kind of human 
        solidarity, rather than pandering to the imagined security needs of land-based 
        national regimes.</p>
      <p>We believe that it should be a general new design principle to add information 
        to a problem, as opposed to countering it with physical resources (in 
        the case of migrants, steel bars and barbed wire). Electronic tracking 
        seems a promising example. While the threat to privacy and anonymity from 
        electronic parole is obviously severe, there is nothing quite so dreadful 
        and threatening as a septic refugee camp. We consider this a matter of 
        some urgency. We believe it to be very likely that massive evacuations 
        will occur in the next few decades as a matter of course, not merely in 
        the disadvantaged Third World, but possibly in areas such as a new American 
        Dust Bowl. Wise investments in electronic tourist management would be 
        well repaid in stitching the fraying fabric of a weather-disrupted civilization.</p>
      <p>For instance, we would expect to see one of the first acts of 21st century 
        disaster management to be sowing an area with air-dropped and satellite-tracked 
        cellphones. We believe that such a tracking and display system could be 
        designed so that it would not be perceived as a threat, but rather as 
        a jet-setter's prestige item, something like a portable personal webpage. 
        We believe such devices should be designed first for the rich. The poor 
        need them worse, but if these devices were developed and given to the 
        poor by socialist fiat, this would be (probably correctly) suspected as 
        being the first step toward police roundup and a death camp.</p>
      <p>Replacing natural resources with information is a natural area for twenty-first 
        century design, because it is an arena for human ingenuity that was technically 
        closed to all previous centuries. We see considerable promise in this 
        approach. It can be both cheap and glamorous.</p>
      <p>Energy meters, for instance, should be ubiquitous. They should be present, 
        not in an obscure box outside the home, but enshrined within it. This 
        is not a frugal, money-saving effort. It should be presented as a luxury. 
        It should be a mark of class distinction. It should be considered a mark 
        of stellar ignorance to be unaware of the source of one's electric power. 
        Solar and wind power should be sold as premiums available to particularly 
        affluent and savvy consumers. It should be considered the stigma of the 
        crass proletarian to foul the air every time one turns on a light switch.</p>
      <p>Environmental awareness is currently an annoying burden to the consumer, 
        who must spend his and her time gazing at plastic recycling labels, washing 
        the garbage and so on. Better information environments can make the invisible 
        visible, however, and this can lead to a swift re-evaluation of previously 
        invisible public ills.</p>
      <p>If one had, for instance, a pair of computerized designer sunglasses 
        that revealed the unspeakable swirl of airborne combustion products over 
        the typical autobahn, it would be immediately obvious that clean air is 
        a luxury. Infrasound, ultrasound and sound pollution monitors would make 
        silence a luxury. Monitor taps with intelligent water analysis in real-time 
        would make pure water a luxury. Lack of mutagens in one's home would become 
        a luxury.</p>
      <p>Freedom from interruption and time to think is a luxury; personal attention 
        is luxury; genuine neighborhood security is also very much to be valued. 
        Social attitudes can and should be changed by the addition of cogent information 
        to situations where invisible costs have long been silently exported into 
        the environment. Make the invisible visible. Don't sell warnings. Sell 
        awareness.</p>
      <p>The fact that we are living in an unprecedently old society, a society 
        top-heavy with the aged, offers great opportunity. Long-term thinking 
        is a useful and worthwhile effort well suited to the proclivities of old 
        people.</p>
      <p>Clearly if our efforts do not work for old people (a large and growing 
        fraction of the G-7 populace) then they will not work at all. Old people 
        tend to be generous, they sometimes have time on their hands. Electronically 
        connected, garrulous oldsters might have a great deal to offer in the 
        way of managing the copious unpaid scutwork of electronic civil society. 
        We like the idea of being a radical art movement that specializes in recruiting 
        the old.</p>
      <p>Ignoring long-term consequences is something we all tend to do; but promulgating 
        dangerous falsehoods for short-term economic gain is exceedingly wicked 
        and stupid. If environmental catastrophe strikes because of CO2 emissions, 
        then organizations like the anti-Green Global Climate Coalition will be 
        guilty of negligent genocide. Nobody has ever been guilty of this novel 
        crime before, but if it happens, it will certainly be a crime of very 
        great magnitude. At this moment, the GCC and their political and economic 
        allies are, at best, engaged in a risky gamble with the lives of billions. 
        If the climate spins out of control, the 21st century may become a very 
        evil place indeed.</p>
      <p>The consequences should be faced directly. If several million people 
        starve to death because, for instance, repeated El Nino events have disrupted 
        major global harvests for years on end, then there will be a catastrophe. 
        There will be enormous political and military pressures for justice and 
        an accounting.</p>
      <p>We surmise that the best solution in this scenario would be something 
        like the Czech lustration and the South African truth commissions. The 
        groundwork for this process should begin now. The alternatives are not 
        promising: a Beirut scenario of endless ulcerous and semi-contained social 
        breakdown; a Yugoslav scenario of climate-based ethnic cleansing and lebensraum; 
        a Red Terror where violent panic-stricken masses seek bloody vengeance 
        against industrialism. Most likely of all is a White Terror, where angry 
        chaos in the climatically disrupted Third World is ruthlessly put down 
        by remote control by the G7's cybernetic military. It is very likely under 
        this last scenario that the West's gluttonous consumption habits will 
        be studiously overlooked, and the blame laid entirely on the Third World's 
        exploding populations. (The weather's savage vagaries will presumably 
        be blamed on some handy Lysenkoist scapegoat such as Jews or unnatural 
        homosexual activities.)</p>
      <p>With the Czech lustration and the South African truth commissions, the 
        late 20th century has given us a mechanism by which societies that have 
        drifted into dysfunctional madness can be put right. We expect no less 
        for future malefactors whose sly defense of an indefensible status quo 
        may lead to the deaths of millions of people, who derived little benefit 
        from their actions and were never given any voice in their decisions. 
        We recommend that dossiers be compiled now, for the sake of future international 
        courts of justice. We think this work should be done quite openly, in 
        a spirit of civic duty. Those who are risking the lives of others should 
        be made aware that this is one particular risk that will be focussed specifically 
        and personally on them.</p>
      <p>While it is politically helpful to have a polarized and personalized 
        enemy class, there is nothing particularly new about this political tactic. 
        Revanchist sentiment is all very well, but survival will require a much 
        larger vision. This must become the work of many people in many fields 
        of labor, ignoring traditional boundaries of discipline and ideology to 
        unite in a single practical goal: climate.</p>
      <p>A brief sketch may help establish some parameters.</p>
      <p>Here I conclude with a set of general cultural changes that a Viridian 
        movement would likely promulgate in specific sectors of society. For the 
        sake of brevity, these suggestions come in three parts. (Today) is the 
        situation as it exists now. (What We Want) is the situation as we would 
        like to see it. (The Trend) the way the situation will probably develop 
        if it follows contemporary trends without any intelligent intervention.</p>

      <p>The Media</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today.</b> Publishing and broadcasting cartels surrounded by a haze 
        of poorly financed subcultural microchannels.</p>
      <p><b>What We Want. </b>More bandwidth for civil society, multicultural 
        variety, and better-designed systems of popular many-to-many communication, 
        in multiple languages through multiple channels.</p>
      <p><b>The Trend. </b>A spy-heavy, commercial Internet. A Yankee entertainment 
        complex that entirely obliterates many non-Anglophone cultures.</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>The Military</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today.</b> G-7 Hegemony backed by the American military.</p>
      <p><b>What We Want</b>. A wider and deeper majority hegemony with a military 
        that can deter adventurism, but specializes in meeting the immediate crises 
        through civil engineering, public health and disaster relief.</p>
      <p><b>The Trend. </b>Nuclear and biological proliferation among minor powers.</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>Business</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today</b>. Currency traders rule banking system by fiat; extreme instability 
        in markets; capital flight but no labor mobility; unsustainable energy 
        base</p>
      <p><b>What We Want.</b> Nonmaterial industries; vastly increased leisure; 
        vastly increased labor mobility; sustainable energy and resources</p>
      <p><b>The Trend.</b> commodity totalitarianism, crony capitalism, criminalized 
        banking systems, sweatshops</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>Industrial Design</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today.</b> very rapid model obsolescence, intense effort in packaging; 
        CAD/CAM</p>
      <p><b>What We Want:</b> intensely glamourous environmentally sound products; 
        entirely new objects of entirely new materials; replacing material substance 
        with information; a new relationship between the cybernetic and the material</p>
      <p><b>The Trend: </b>two design worlds for rich and poor comsumers; a varnish 
        on barbarism</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>Gender Issues</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today: </b>more commercial work required of women; social problems 
        exported into family life as invisible costs</p>
      <p><b>What We Want: </b>declining birth rates, declining birth defects, 
        less work for anyone, lavish support for anyone willing to drop out of 
        industry and consume less</p>
      <p><b>The Trend: </b>more women in prison; fundamentalist and ethnic-separatist 
        ideologies that target women specifically.</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>Entertainment</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today: </b>large-scale American special-effects spectacle supported 
        by huge casts and multi-million-dollar tie-in enterprises</p>
      <p><b>What We Want: </b>glamour and drama; avant-garde adventurism; a borderless 
        culture industry bent on Green social engineering</p>
      <p><b>The Trend: </b>annihilation of serious culture except in a few non-Anglophone 
        societies</p>
      <b>
      <p><font size=4>International Justice</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today: </b>dysfunctional but gamely persistent War Crimes tribunals</p>
      <p><b>What We Want: </b>Environmental Crime tribunals</p>
      <p><b>The Trend: </b>justice for sale; intensified drug war</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>Employment</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today: </b>MacJobs, burn-out track, massive structural unemployment 
        in Europe</p>
      <p><b>What We Want: </b>Less work with no stigma; radically expanded leisure; 
        compulsory leisure for workaholics; guaranteed support for people consuming 
        less resources; new forms of survival entirely outside the conventional 
        economy</p>
      <p><b>The Trend: </b>increased class division; massive income disparity; 
        surplus flesh and virtual class</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>Education</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today: </b>failing public-supported schools</p>
      <p><b>What We Want: </b>intellectual freedom, instant cheap access to information, 
        better taste, a more advanced aesthetic, autonomous research collectives, 
        lifelong education, and dignity and pleasure for the very large segment 
        of the human population who are and will forever be basically illiterate 
        and innumerate</p>
      <p><b>The trend: </b>children are raw blobs of potential revenue-generating 
        machinery; universities exist to supply middle-management</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>Public Health</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today: </b>general success; worrying chronic trends in AIDS, tuberculosis, 
        antibiotic resistance; massive mortality in nonindustrial world</p>
      <p><b>What We Want: </b>unprecedently healthy old people; plagues exterminated 
        worldwide; sophisticated treatment of microbes; artificial food</p>
      <p><b>The Trend: </b>Massive dieback in Third World, septic poor quarantined 
        from nervous rich in G-7 countries, return of 19th century sepsis, world's 
        fattest and most substance-dependent populations</p>
      <b><font size=4>
      <p>Science</p>
      </b>
      <p><b>Today: </b>basic science sacrificed for immediate commercial gain; 
        malaise in academe; bureaucratic overhead in government support</p>
      <p><b>What We Want: </b>procedural rigor, intellectual honesty, reproducible 
        results; peer review, block grants, massively increased research funding, 
        massively reduced procedural overhead; genius grants; single-author papers; 
        abandonment of passive construction and the third person plural; "Science" 
        reformed so as to lose its Platonic and crypto-Christian elements as the 
        "pure" pursuit of disembodied male minds; armistice in Science wars</p>
      <p><b>The Trend: </b>"Big Science" dwindles into short-term industrial research 
        or military applications; "scientists" as a class forced to share imperilled, 
        marginal condition of English professors and French deconstructionists.</p>
      <p>I would like to conclude by suggesting some specific areas for immediate 
        artistic work. I see these as crying public needs that should be met by 
        bravura displays of raw ingenuity.</p>
      <p>But there isn't time for that. Not just yet.</p>
